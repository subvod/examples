# Information

This is a collection of numerical data taken during and after testing many aspects of the game. It is meant to be a comprehensive analysis and data archive. All comments which come the slightest bit close to being biased towards a personal opinion will be listed at the bottom of this document. Want some tips on how to efficiently go about killing the Predator? Or maybe read some long ass paragraphs of nothing but opinionated rambling? Head down to the bottom of the document. Otherwise, continue down for the test results.

# Tips, Tricks, Warnings, and Rambling

### How does explosion damage work?

Explosions work just as they do in other games: more damage as you get closer to the center. Damage radius limits have proven to be difficult to pinpoint (outside of player's explosives). As far as damage through walls, no explosive damage penetrates a "solid" surface (what the game considers to be solid e.g. concrete, brick, etc; excludes tents, fences, etc). Now, damage doesn't penetrate solid surfaces, but explosive force does. This means within the spherical radius, anything which can be affected by explosions will be triggered. This includes gate locks blowing off, windows shattering, boxes destroyed, etc.

### How to effectively take on enemies?

Try to stay stealthy. Stealth kills get a huge damage boost, so most enemies require only one shot to kill (outside of tier mode). Now, how about when you're made? Shoot and scoot. When you fire a shot or an explosion goes off while enemies are hunting you, they will rush the position that shot/explosion came from. This includes shooting an enemy but not killing them. Use cover appropriately and place mines behind you when you shift positions. Sometimes, proximity mines by themselves may not deal enough damage to take down an enemy, especially in online matchmaking. I recommend using a proxy combined with a C4 or mine. Basically just set down a C4/mine, then a proxy directly next to or on top of it. Not only do you expand your explosion radius, the explosion from the C4 essentially guarantees the kill. This isn't to knock the fact that the Prox Mine and Mine work differently. The Prox Mine is triggered exclusively by personnel walking within the trigger radius. While the Mine is triggered by both vehicles and personnel, it is triggered by a dead hit. This means it has no trigger radius and must be crossed or stepped on to be activated.

### Why use diversion lures over flashbangs?

When used efficiently, diversion lures can do the same job as flashbangs, especially with the double explosion radius skill. Not to mention div lures do not alert affected enemies, while flashbangs do.

### Convoy takedown and farming resources?

Basically, the most efficient method is to run a low tier profile in single player Guerilla Mode. You get hundreds of thousands of resources from a completed 25-wave game. To make it easy, wait until the last few enemies are automatically marked. Use sync shot to take off remaining enemies, leaving at least one. Run to him, grab him, turn on your tier mode, and then knock him out. Not only do you get tons of resources every fifth wave, tier mode also yields way more "scrap" used for buying weapons, attachments, skills, etc. This gives 600,000 resources (of varying types) in one 25-wave run through.
The EMP drone is hit or miss from my experience, especially if you EMP the main vehicle when it's traveling on even the slightest downhill strech. They'll just coast down and move on when the engine starts back up. The most effective method proven from testing is using sync shot for the driver and passenger, then a one-shot weapon for the escort vehicles (SR25 Jungle or Desert Tech HTI BDC). Second most effective is flashbang, then take out the driver and passenger yourself by shooting through the side window(s). Yes, flashbanging enemies inside vehicles works. Third most effective is the makeshift claymore method, setting a mine, then C4s in a backwards direction. This ensures the front vehicle sets off the initial explosion, which travels backwards and subsequently destroys all vehicles in the convoy (except for a heli if it has one). This method destroys the truck itself, halving the yield, therefore it's listed as the least effective.
  
### Why the M4A1 is the best gun overall?

The LVOA-C Bad News is not the best, nor is the Mk 17 (SCAR-H). The M4A1, in practice during direct engagement, takes down any armored enemy in four shots while using full auto. It also has the second highest rate of fire among assault rifles (next to the G2 FAMAS). This means it has the lowest potential TTK among assault rifles. The burst trigger put against a Unidad or Santa Blanca heavy is where the M4A1 with a standard barrel falls behind. However that setback is not enough to significantly tank its ranking as it remains the best all-around weapon in general. By default, the AK-12 (chambered in 7.62x39mm) and G36C (chambered in 5.56x45mm, same as the M4A1) with the standard barrel and burst trigger will take down any enemy in a single burst of three (via burst trigger). Where as the M4A1 with the standard barrel and burst trigger will take **TWO** bursts of three. In reality it amounts to a four-shot kill. But the M4A1's two-burst kill potential is only applicable during engaging a heavy machine gunner. That, and when in full auto it still kills faster with four shots than every other assault rifle, including both the AK-12 and G36C. With the long barrel, the M4A1 gains the single burst kill potential the AK-12 and G36C inherently have with the standard barrel against a Unidad heavy. Additionally, the long barrel and 50-round magazine do affect handling, but the drop in ADS time and movement speed is noticable. Nonetheless, it still kills faster than every other assault rifle. Be that as it may, the M4A1, G36C, and AK-12 are among the same line on the performance spectrum and give you everything. You can go from nice and quiet to loud and proud without changing weapons and still remain just as effective. They are easy to control with soft and manageable recoil (even with the long barrel and no compensator). Not to mention they can be effective out to and beyond 200m even when used by literal noobs. However the M4A1 is the victor.
  
### What are the best optics?

Technically speaking, it's more personal preference rather than testable statistics. Despite logic (being more accurate simply by using your preferred optic), optics directly affect accuracy and shot groupings (accordingly to what's shown on the stats page, which is one of the few accurate depictions of performance changes). This means that any assault rifle will have the closest shot groupings with the TA31H attached. Same goes for all weapons of all classes with all optics. The G33 magnifier widens shot groupings, so be aware of that. Speficially for me, I enjoy using the Panoramic Sight and CompM4 on everything I can. The CompM4 is the only optic (aside from the TA31H ACOG to some extent) that eliminates the lens glare that all other optics exhibit in certain lighting. That, and the CompM4 always has a zero'd red dot, unlike the Micro T1. In the same way, the Digital Scope, TA31H, Russian Red Dot, and Micro T-1 (with and without G33 magnifier) have offset zeros on all weapons. (I.e. they don't hit dead center on the dot. Usually a bit to the right most of the time, if not much farther down than center dot.) The CompM4, Panoramic Sight, EXPS3, and PK-AS are always properly zeroed on the center dot on every weapon. As for glare-prone optics, I use the Panoramic Sight because it's got the lowest parallax and least sight picture interference, as well as a larger and more defined reticle than the EXPS3. The G33 magnifier works decent on all compatible optics, but the Micro T1 dot becomes a red blob when magnified (making it harder to pinpoint exactly where I'm aiming especially past 150m). The Micro-T1 by itself isn't terrible for CQB, but if you can't deal with the tiny sight and tendency for glare you're likely better off with the CompM4. But, as stated earlier, it's purely preferential.
  
For sniper optics, same thing: personal preference. Technically, snipers and DMRs are less affected by accuracy as they're generally used in semi-auto or are bolt action. The T5Xi can be offset quite a bit on certain weapons, but provides the best accuracy and highest zoom. The POSP and TARS101 are widely reliable on all sniper rifles, though their offset zeros are worse on some. The G28 offers a 5.0x scope similar to the T5Xi with an alternate 1.0x red dot (Micro T-1) for quick change to CQB, but the reticle is zeroed on that red dot rather than the center crosshair on the high magnification scope below it, meaning it essentially zeroes the weapon out even farther. This is generally regarded as the most effective sniper scope. I personally recommend the G28 for sniping much in the same way many other people do, but also regularly use the TARS101 simply because of the look (and comparable zoom levels with minimal accuracy loss).

# Game Modes

### Tier Mode

You unlock Tier Mode by reaching level 30. After turning it on, you start at tier 50 and work your way down to tier 1. You get rewards of prestige credits and resources after unlocking each tier all the way to tier 1, with the final reward being 10 times the normal reward given for all prior 49 tiers. Additionally, you get cosmetic and weapon rewards: Jaws mask, Wingnut helmet, Red Shemagh, Operator mask, Desert Tech HTI BDC, and LVOA-C Bad News. As you crawl down each tier enemies have more health/armor and spot you more quickly. What that really means is at tier 1 you barely have time to react to being spotted. Your weapons also do less damage unless you upgrade them. Every weapon starts at level 1 and maxes out at level 30. <u>Be aware a level 30 gun in tier mode is essentially what it is outside of tier mode.</u>
  
### Ghost Mode

Permadeath. Sounds fun, right? I'll give the quick run-down of Ghost Mode: prepare your asshole. You get one primary weapon slot and one sidearm slot, use them wisely. Ghost Mode also has Tier Mode within it. Also, you get the exoskeleton pieces in Ghost Mode. See Ghost Mode Speedrun for recommendations on busting through for the gold exoskeleton suit.
  
### Guerilla Mode

This is a survival game mode which rewards you with Prestige Credits and Resources every fifth wave up to 25 waves. Rewards double after each "raid" (group of five waves). Resource types vary by randomization. You choose an existing gamesave slot to use and begin on Wave 1. There is an intermission period between each wave. During this intermission, a shopkeep opens up and the player is able to purchase weapons, attachments, consumables (grenades, flashbangs, mines, etc), skills, and bonus medals with "scrap" obtained by getting kills and completing waves. The shop closes when the intermission period ends and the next wave begins, and remains closed for the duration of the wave while active. Most items in the shop are randomized each game and may include DLC weapons. Upon completing (the 25th and final wave of) Guerilla Mode for the first time, players receive an exclusive shirt and pants combo, labelled as the "Survivor" set. These can only be obtained by completing Guerilla Mode. Additionally, Prestige Credits rewards repeat, meaning every 25-wave game will yield 500 prestige credits.
  
Guerilla Mode can be used in conjunction with Tier Mode. Multipliers carry over to tier points, kill/completion scrap, and resource rewards. A tier one player can make a heap of resources in a full 25-wave run. The stats below were taken from a full 25-wave run with tier mode (tier one) on for every fifth wave. If you somehow managed to roll the same resource for all raids, you can make up to 855,600 resources of any given type.

# Enemy Alert States

There are five (5) alert states which enemies of any faction can be in. The icon above enemies which have no alert status will not blink. At "Suspected" and "Hunted", the icon will begin to blink slowly. At "Engaged" status, the icon blinks rapidly. The "Hunted" stage is broken into two separate stages despite what's shown above the minimap, but the rate of icon blinking is the same between the two.

If the player is near a road, ground vehicles will be sent out. Otherwise, a helicopter will be sent.

The enemies will move to your last known location, search the area, and upon nothing being found return to "Normal".</td>

### Remote Campsites/Checkpoints

These are randomly populated by cartel and/or Unidad and/or rebel forces, anywhere from 2 to 4 of each type. Sometimes these campsites will have two or three factions, meaning one day you might pass it with just two cartel gunners while the next may have both Unidad and rebels. Population conditions are unknown. There is a special type of campsite spawn where it appears the cartel and Unidad are negotiating. In this scenario, there will be a Santa Blanca Veteran along with two Santa Blanca Soldiers and an Unidad Veteran with two Unidad Soldiers.

### Road Patrols

Below is data taken from observing road patrol vehicles in the full game and both DLCs. Unidad road patrols and cartel reinforcement vehicles' occupants may vary based on location, e.g. more difficult provinces will have more heavies and veterans (and more occupants in general). A Unidad 4x4 in Itacua will have two soldiers, a driver and gunner, while the same vehicle in Koani may be loaded down with four heavies. Exceptions to this rule (those with occupants which do not vary based on location) are marked with an asterisk.

# Stealth Mechanics

All weapon classes have their own noise detection with no difference between weapons of the same class despite what the "noise reduction" bar may show. Compensators do not affect noise, again despite what the stat bar shows. Below are the maximum distances at which gunfire is heard by an enemy NPC. This is a flat number, no variables change noise detection distance. For example, an enemy will hear your unsuppressed MP5 at 60m, but if you take a mere one step backwards he won't hear a thing at 61m.

Time of day also plays a part in visual detection distance (lighting in general does). Ubisoft ported a Splinter Cell system of sorts. It allows for variable detection speed based on light level. Dark areas reveal less therefore you get spotted slower in the shadows. Opposite goes for broad daylight in an open field with no brush. Speaking of bushes, they act as concealment for all players but not NPCs. You can mark an enemy hiding behind a bush, but they cannot see you hiding behind the same bush. Enemies will also not see you behind any sort of solid cover. However you can get spotted hiding behind what may appear to be solid cover. Things like boxes and metal dolleys, basically everything that you can move by just walking into it, is not cover nor concealment despite its solid appearance. The game engine treats all moveable objects as simply that and no more. Below are the ranges at which enemies begin to spot the player. These were tested in barren, unobscured conditions (no cover/concealment blocking view) against both SBC and Unidad forces at the Koani Air Base in Koani and F.O.B. Serpiente in Flor de Oro. No spotting distance differences were found between factions nor solider types (unarmored, vested, veteran, heavy). Snipers are the only NPC type which has altered sight distances, rightfully so. All of that into account, apparently Unidad is no more elite than some cokeheads with guns.

# Weapon Stats

### The Best Loadout

Statistically speaking, the best loadout in vanilla Wildlands (the stock version of the game excluding DLCs and crate unlocks) for covering all ranges is: M4A1, MSR, and Lady Killer. The M4A1 has the fastest potential TTK over all other assault rifles. The MSR, when equipped with the long barrel, holds one-shot kill potential anywhere on the body. (All other sniper rifles do not have that capability except for the HTI. However the HTI is also bolt-action and holds only five (5) rounds.) The Lady Killer has the highest damage of all pistols in the stock game. Both the Five-seveN Blacklist and Whisper (a.k.a. the Maxim 9) are the only silent pistols in the game, but the Whisper has the absolute lowest damage of any weapon in the game. DLC weapons which perform better than the aforementioned are the SR25 Jungle (sniper) and Five-seveN Blacklist (pistol). The SR25 Jungle has 20-round capacity, is semi-auto, and shoots flat out to 350m and holds one-shot capability to everything, identical to the Desert Tech HTI BDC. Therefore the statistical best loadout including DLC weapons is: M4A1, SR25 Jungle, and Five-seveN Blacklist.

### Critical Hit Mechanics
  
A critical hit deals double the damage of a regular round fired from a weapon. After extensive gameplay, the way the game appears to calculate critical hit chance is dependent upon four factors: **shots fired**, **length of burst**, **shot placement**, and **target proximity**. I say four because any weapon (outside of Tier Mode and other than the Whisper pistol) will always one-shot unalerted enemies regardless of armor level. The game appears to just automatically kick the damage booster to well over 100% so as to guarantee a one-shot kill. Headshots work in this same manner. That being the case, analysis results will be based on experience with alerted enemies, specifically and exclusively regular Unidad soldiers (not heavy machine gunners or veterans).
	
The game does appear to have a "damage drop over distance" mechanic, or something that could be perceived as such. It also (sort of) parallels the way damage range works in Call of Duty: the farther your bullet goes the less damage it deals, meaning it will take more rounds to kill an enemy at longer ranges than the same weapon against the same enemy at shorter ranges. Less chance of a crit means you must rely on your weapon's base, raw damage. Weapons with a lower damage-per-round are rendered virtually ineffective at distances over 200m. Even some sniper rifles, ahem cough G28, lose out from a distance (since the goal of using a sniper rifle should be to kill in one shot rather than, say six) again erm cough G28 and Mk 14 cough cough. The critical hit damage multiplier is also lowered over distance. Meaning not only do you have a lower chance of landing a crit, even if you land a lucky crit it may as well have been a regular hit.
	
**Balancing For Critical Hits:** High rate of fire means a higher chance of landing a critical hit. Most weapons with a low rate of fire have higher base damage compared to other weapons in their class to compensate for the lower rate of fire (thus lower chance of critting). However, as far as balancing goes, the M4A1 is about as good as it gets when it comes to "the best of both worlds". Closely ranked competitors are the AK-12 and G36C.

### Testing Restrictions and Controlled Variables

Hard target (vehicle) tests were conducted at Koani Bravo on extreme difficulty, tier mode off, against a player-spawned Unidad APC. Weapons had no attachments other than barrel modifications listed. Soft target (regular Unidad solider, not heavy or veteran) were tested at M.O.B. Jaguar in Flor de Oro, M.O.B. Condor in Media Luna, and F.O.B. Serpiente in Flor de Oro (used in Narco Road DLC because of high target count). All soft targets were taken out within "Engaged" status at point blank range (within 10m). Base damage values were recorded using semi-auto trigger with any weapon where it was available, otherwise full auto was used in a one-round burst fashion if a weapon did not offer a semi-auto trigger. All shots taken were center-mass and kept above the waistline. Kills involving any sort of critical hit were disregarded to avoid inflating the numbers.

### Soft Targets

Soft target "burst potential" testing is meant to give some idea as to how effective the weapon is in full auto and burst firing modes. This is meant to reveal a rough TTK based on number of rounds per burst. All burst tests start at the highest ROF trigger (three round burst). If a 3RB trigger wasn't available, full auto was used. If the only firing mode available is semi-auto, the weapon was fired as quickly as possible. For sniper rifles, base soft target damage was tested in two ways to ensure accuracy: shooting the feet and shooting the chest. If a sniper rifle has '1' in the "soft target" column, it will one-shot even in the foot. Otherwise, the maximum number of shots taken to the foot was listed. Some sniper rifles (such as the M40A5 and all sniper rifles chambered in .338LM) may one-shot center mass, but require two shots on extremeties. These individual differences were not recorded, as the MSR (with a long barrel) is the only .338LM rifle which kills in one shot regardless of shot placement. For sniper rifle "burst potential" within bolt actions, the least number of chest shots taken was used. (This is to show possible discrepancies between different hitboxes). For all weapons, aim down sight target lock-on assistance was used and firing began right after full ADS (scope in). Only targets that ate the entire burst were counted, all others were disregarded. Same as flat damage values, kills involving critical hits were disregarded as well.
	
### Penetration

Each weapon class has its own penetration, as in they're guaranteed to shoot through certain surfaces. Some weapons penetrate more surfaces than others, as in one may go through a sandbag while another of the same class may not. For the most part, almost all weapons of a class will penetrate the same surface types and layers. Weapon penetration (both statistical and as shown in-game) appears to have no effect on armored personnel targets.

### Shotguns

It's rather difficult to test shotgun damage and maintain control of consistency. Shotgun damage tests on soft targets were done the same as every other weapon, up close and personal, to ensure no excess of rogue variables. Within 10m, all shotguns' spread remains in an area small enough to keep track of how many shells are fired. Past a certain distance (varying from shotgun to shotgun) the spread progressively widens, making farther shots difficult to record.

### "Special" Weapons

These are the guns that cannot be edited in the Gunsmith. Take note that the name of the weapon doesn't indicate it operates the same way its stock counterpart does. Differences may include bullet drop, base damage, rate of fire, reload speed, etc. For example, the P416 Micteca operates as if it were an M4A1 while the M4A1 Temple operates as if it were an M16.

### Pistol Stats

Below are test results for all sidearms in the game. Range values are tested maximums and are listed as 1m below the distance at which the bullet loses substance (is no longer considered a shot by the game). Hard target values are shots taken to destroy a Pickup. Soft target values are shots taken against a Unidad soldier.

### Shotgun Ranges

Below are test results for maximum shotgun ranges with all available barrels. Distances listed are 1m less than when all pellets lose substance. Ideally, the maximum range is 1m to 2m less than what is listed here as at these distances a mere one (1) pellet will land somewhere near where you shot. Since shot spread is randomly generated, you're always rolling the dice at landing a hit at these ranges. Moving in 1m or 2m ensures all pellets retain substance and hit the target.

### Sniper Rifle Bullet Drop

This list is in descending order, with the highest hitting (least bullet drop) rifles at the top and lowest hitting (most bullet drop) rifles at the bottom. Each cell acts as its own drop rate, meaning all weapons within a row have either the exact same bullet drop or the difference between the weapons in the group was so minor that it could be attributed to breath movement/sway while aiming. All tests were conducted at M.O.B. Condor in Media Luna (on the airstrip section) at 300m. All rifles were set up with the TARS101 optic, longest applicable barrel, and no suppressor. Shots were fired at the bottom of each breath sway.
	
**DISCLAIMER:** YouTube creator *DarkDally* and many others have noted the scope zeroing differences between scopes and rifles. In an effort to ensure the most accurate data is recorded, markers were not used to zero the shots. Instead, rifle after rifle, the shot was scoped in to the exact same place the previous shot was, otherwise known as not moving the thumbsticks. This prevents misalignment due to camera movement and ensures every shot is taken at the exact same location regardless of where the rifle is zeroed with any optic. The original idea for this came from noting how every weapon is dead zero on the in-game crosshair (in third person). The crosshair placement might be skewed while aiming down sights, but the gun will not shoot skewed from the game's crosshair.

# FAQ

*Faq, glitches and easter eggs.* **SPOILERS AHEAD!**
	  
### Ghost Mode speedrun for Gold Exoskeleton suit?

The fastest and easiest way to go about getting the gold exo is to run a tier point grinding route. That, and using the right weapon. You can essentially use any weapon you choose, but as listed above some are statistically better than others. If when you start out you die often, it's best to use a weapon that is preconfigured with usable attachments, namely the M203 grenade launcher. Not only is it super overpowered in this game, you can use it despite not having the skill unlocked after restarting a new save with certain weapons. These are: M16 (from Predator DLC pack), 556xi Dragon (from Fallen Ghosts weapons DLC pack), and P416 Micteca (from Prestige Crates). Ritmo obtained from DJ Perico and the LVOA-C Bad News have the M203 but are unlocked with further progression, limiting their initial use.) I personally recommend the P416 Micteca as it is an M4A1 with a P416 skin and can equip a suppressor, but next in line is the M16 which operates in the same manner with a lower rate of fire.
		
If you run the route effectively, you can get the gold exo suit rather quickly. I flew through the storyline and ground out to tier 1 in about 48 hours. Granted, this was after 15 attempts and about six months of prior play. Two saves I lost were under tier 10, one at tier 8 and another at tier 6.

### How does the Optical Camo backpack work?

A common misconception of the Optical Camo backpack (from completing both parts of Operation Silent Spade) is that it reduces the distance at which you're detected. What it actually does is reduce the speed at which you're detected rather than the distance.
	  
### Optical Camo backpack makes me just a floating balaclava.

The Optical Camo backpack is incompatible with a select few cosmetic items. Certain footwear and head/facewear will cause some pieces of clothing to be visible even when cloaked. Switching around a few items usually fixes this issue.
    
### How to beat The Predator?

This is rather simple. Grab your M4 and max out your "Guns for Hire" and "Diversion" rebel support skills. After that, go to the Predator's mission location, talk to the lady, investigate the locations, and move to the final waypoint. **BEFORE YOU ENTER THE CIRCLE TO START THE FINAL STAGE**, call in your rebels. The reason they are so important, or rather not, is because they'll act as bait. The Predator will lock onto them rather than you and your teammates, opening up more opportunities to fire upon it.
        
The Predator itself does not have a definite health amount. Rather, he has a hit counter. Now... ideally if you're looking for numbers, drop your M4A1 for a Scorpion EVO 3. Higher rate of fire means you reach that hit counter faster. Do not attempt to shoot the Predator if you see him running around while cloaked. Hits landed in that stage do not count towards the total, for some reason. If you are locked onto, take cover **only if you know for sure you're covered.** The Predator's gun has radial damage because it is, indeed, an explosion. I recommend moving about more than taking cover. Why? Once you get the timing down you can dodge his shots with ease, much in the same way you dodge SAMs in an aircraft. The Predator's lasers track the target, so you could be running just around the corner of a tree and the laser will curve with you. My dodging strategy hasn't changed since I first got it down: as soon as you're locked onto, sprint in a straight line either directly towards or away from the Predator. When you hear him fire his laser thing, judge the length of time it will take for it to reach you (based on distance from him i.e. how loud the laser firing is). At just over &frac78; of that time, turn right or left to dodge.
    
Once you get that strategy down, you're golden. The Predator will become easier and easier the more you practice it.
	  
### Beat General Baro easily.

Having trouble taking General Baro? Plant yourself just outside of the mission circle (after talking to his daughter). Fire a round near him to alert him. This will cause him to run the same way a lietenant does. Sometimes a truck will spawn in front of the barn opening, which blocks his path outwards. To fix this, either wait until he runs around the truck, or shoot it until it explodes. In the latter case, he will dodge the explosion (most of the time, sometimes it'll kill him). Wait until he runs close to you <u>and outside of the circle</u>. The reason he needs to be outside of the circle is to avoid triggering the Unidad spawn. Grab him, stow him (preferably in a heli), and fly through the circle to trigger the checkpoint and Unidad spawn. Fly all the way to the rally point and you're golden. Most of the time, the flight to the RP is long enough to lose the Unidad alert.

### Unique Melee Animations

Whenever the player makes a melee kill while wearing the *Tank Top + Predator Wristblades*, *Caviera Gloves*, *Echelon Gloves*, or *Executioner (handwear)* a melee animation unique to the item will be used.

### Caviera Gloves Automatic Marking

Whenever a player makes a melee kill while wearing the *Caviera Gloves*, up to 4 enemies within the immediate area (inside the minimap) will be marked automatically.

### The Predator Mask's Infrared Thermal Vision, NVG Goggles Steiner Vision, and Splinter Cell Grayscale Vision Modes

After completing *"The Jungle Moved"* by killing the Predator, the player is awarded the center piece of the Predator's helmet: its mask. While wearing it, the player can use the Predator's specialized thermal vision. While in this vision mode, game audio is filtered and sounds as if the Predator were hearing it. Alternatively, the Predator Helmet (with the tentacles/dreads) provides the same effect and comes in the Predator Pack (available periodically from the "Limited Time Offers" section of the store menu).
The grayscale vision mode can be accessed via the SONAR Goggles. The Steiner Vision mode can be accessed by using a helmet with either the "Special NVG" or "Panoramic NVG". The "Monocular NVG" (both helmet flip-down and head brace type), "Advanced Ballistics Helmet", "Echelon Goggles", "Monocular Helmet", and "Conviction NVG" do not have special vision modes.

### El Tio

To activate this Easter egg, the player must "Investigate" three sheets of paper at three separate grave sites at the Ancient Cemetery of Miners on the border of Inca Camina and Pucara (Northeast of Inca Camina Echo). The papers are located at graves which are the only ones that glow red at night (due to candles). The exact GPS coordinates of the three are as follows:
		  
Lat: -19.6647, Long: -64.0323<br>
Lat: -19.7359, Long: -64.1272<br>
Lat: -19.6253, Long: -64.1516<br>
		  
Next step is to travel to three mineshafts and kill all sicarios with the "El Tio" face paint. The mineshafts are listed as: "**Old Silver Mine**", "**Old Silver Mine**" in Pucara, "**Outpost**" (Southwest of "Banado" in Malca), and "**Pilca Mine**" in Pucara.
		  
After killing all sicarios inside the mine with the "El Tio" face paint, travel to "**Pucara**" in Pucara (yes, Pucara, Pucara, that's not a typo). There should be bright red flare smoke if you activated the Easter egg correctly, and El Tio should be waiting there.

### Crooked Optics

This is unintential on Ubisoft's part. Almost all optics shoot a tiny bit to the right of their center crosshair/dot. Some shoot a bit to the left and some shoot higher or lower (namely on select sniper rifles).

### Z93 AMR "Extra Round"

While using the Z93 AMR, the player can switch weapons (between classes), then swich back to the Z93 and it will have a 6th round in the magazine rather than the regular 5. This effect does not carry over after reload, however.

### Ghost Mode Full Loadout

While in Ghost Mode, the player may find that they have a second primary weapon on their back after messing about in the selection menu. The weapon will remain usable in that save and cannot be swapped afterwards. The weapon itself appears to be random. The cause of this is unknown as of right now.

### M.O.B. Condor Full House

Before interacting with Scott Mitchell in the first part of "Operation: Silent Spade", the player can travel to the Condor Airbase in eastern Media Luna to engage a ton of Unidad soldiers (way more than usual). This happens in both the regular game and Ghost Mode. The game has individual NPC information for some specialized missions, such as animations for cutscenes, travel paths, clothing, voice lines, etc. This means as long as you don't trigger Operation: Silent Spade, tons of Unidad will remain at M.O.B. Condor indefinitely. Very convenient and quite fun when looking for a nice firefight.

### Bullet Sponge Enemies

When an enemy is mounted on a vehicle turret, they will take considerably more hits to kill. This is intentional. However the game treats the "cover" animations in the same manner. If you throw a grenade or send in mortars within close proximity to an enemy (same for hostile grenades and mortars) they will enter the "cover" animation, squatting down and covering their face.

### Mesh Glitch in ADS

While wearing some icon skins (Smoke, Kapkan, etc) and using certain weapons (M4A1, 416, etc.) with certain optics (CompM4, Digital Scope, TA31H, etc), the player may be able to see some parts of the character mesh while aiming down sight. Notable optics which resolve this (still unfixed) issue are the Panoramic Sight and EXPS3.
