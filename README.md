# Introduction

Here's a few clips I enjoy listening to. They'll give you a feel for how I operate:

That out of the way, this is a jumbled assortment of random scripts and snippets for referential purposes. I'm not some big time developer. I've spent (probably more than) my fair share of time tinkering around with over 20 languages, but I've primarily focused on C++ and Python since 2013. The few reference files I have for C/C++ are super basic functions I found online for different projects of my own, so I feel no need to upload them here. However, in a section below, I will link all libraries and tools I've used both inside and outside programming.

[Turn Notepad++ into an IDE of sorts](https://github.com/subvod/examples/blob/master/NPP-IDE.MD) using **NPPExec** and **Notepad++ Macros**. Can be modified to work with any command-line compiler for any language.

[Automate the download and conversion/extraction of audio and video from the internet](https://github.com/subvod/examples/blob/master/youtube-dl.MD) using **youtube-dl** and **ffmpeg**.

[RDR2.MD](https://github.com/subvod/examples/blob/master/RDR2.MD). *Red Dead Redemption 2 Reference Document* - Hodgepodge of notes, but not disorganized. Contains things such as getting the Silver Dapple Pinto MFT as Arthur, glitches/bugs (and known fixes for them), etc.

[stats.html](https://github.com/subvod/examples/blob/master/stats.html) *Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands Reference Document* - Referential document containing weapon, vehicle, and NPC data, among other things.

[ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (2021) Review](https://github.com/subvod/examples/blob/master/2021-ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-G14-GA401QM-Review.md) - A not-so-in-depth review of the 2021 ASUS G14 because I'm a fucking normie piece of shit. :)
