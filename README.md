# Introduction

Here's a few clips I enjoy listening to. They'll give you a feel for how I operate:

That out of the way, this is a jumbled assortment of random scripts and snippets for referential purposes. I'm not some big time developer. I've spent (probably more than) my fair share of time tinkering around with over 20 languages, but I've primarily focused on C++ and Python since 2013. The few reference files I have for C/C++ are super basic functions I found online for different projects of my own, so I feel no need to upload them here. However, in a section below, I will link all libraries and tools I've used both inside and outside programming.

[rdr2-maps](https://github.com/subvod/rdr2-maps) *Red Dead Redemption 2 Map Archives* - Locations for rare/uncommon animals and places you can sit in Red Dead Redemption 2.
