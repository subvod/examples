# Information

Here's a few clips I enjoy listening to. They'll give you a feel for how I operate:

That out of the way, this is a jumbled assortment of random scripts and snippets for referential purposes.

[Turn Notepad++ into an IDE of sorts](https://github.com/subvod/examples/blob/master/NPP-IDE.MD) using **NPPExec** and **Notepad++ Macros**. Can be modified to work with any command-line compiler for any language.

[Automate the download and conversion/extraction of audio and video from the internet](https://github.com/subvod/examples/blob/master/youtube-dl.MD) using **youtube-dl** and **ffmpeg**, and learned a bit of Markdown in the process. Original plan was to use HTML and CSS, but GitHub thought otherwise and the concept of Markdown interests me nonetheless.

[RDR2.MD](https://github.com/subvod/examples/blob/master/RDR2.MD). *Red Dead Redemption 2 Reference Document* - Everything from damn moose locations to getting the Silver Dapple Pinto MFT as Arthur.

[stats.html](https://github.com/subvod/examples/blob/master/stats.html) *Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands* - Referential document containing weapon data, among other things.

[ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (2021) Review](https://github.com/subvod/examples/blob/master/2021-ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-G14-GA401QM-Review.md) - A not-so-in-depth review of the 2021 ASUS G14 because I'm a fucking normie piece of shit. :)

I've also added some reference links to the bottom of this page. Those are all programs/libraries I've used at some point or another, most of which I still consistently use today. Audio, video, image, and 3D editing tools. Extensive external libraries for several languages. GameBoy and GameBoy Color development tools. Everything down there I find interesting or useful in some way. [Might want to take a peek if you're the adventurous type.](#miscellaneous)
