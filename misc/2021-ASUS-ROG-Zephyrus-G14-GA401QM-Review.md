# 2021 ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 Review (GA401QM)

*Just my thoughts so far.*

### Update 2023/03/12

&emsp;Stopped using controller to play RDR2 and GRW. God, this thing gets toasty. On **Performance** mode running GTA5, RDR2, and GRW, I'd be hovering around 88-92&deg;C. Had to change to **Manual** mode and set both CPU and GPU fans to kick in 100% at 49&deg;C. Having done that I can sit around a comfortable 62&deg;C, and in less demanding scenarios hover around 48&deg;C.

### Specifications

- AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS @ 3.3 GHz
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060
- Windows 10 64-bit
- FHD 144 Hz "PANTONE Validated" 100% sRGB Display (1920x1080)

### Is it better than the 2020 model/version?

Arguably, yes. In the 2020 model, you get the updated hardware as opposed to its matching counterpart (AMD R9-4900HS and RTX-2060). I had the 2020 model for two months, during which I ran the same tests and games. The performance difference is most noticable in RDR2, where the 2020 model consistently runs a mere 3 fps slower. Oh no! That's a game-changing difference, right?! As far as I'm concerned, no. I got the 2020 model on special at Best Buy for $1,200. The $1,600 price tag of the 2021 model is quite a jump but from what I've tested not worth the $400 difference. The only reason I bought the 2021 model was to have current-day hardware just to squeeze out a bit more lifetime out of this little monster. If you're looking for the 2021 model, but cheaper and a mere 3fps slower all-around, go for the 2020 model.

### What am I comparing it to?

I'm coming from an **Acer ASPIRE 5250-P5WE6**. It's done what I've thrown at it just fine since I got it in 2012. Ran Halo CE and Homeworld 2 flawlessly (on low settings, of course). Also ran emulators great, as if they are/were power-hungry. The 17" screen is nice, but as far as I'm concerned a 14" doesn't make a whole lot of difference when I can just HDMI it to a larger monitor.

### Gaming Performance

Runs all games I play great. Forza Motorsport 7 runs at smooth 144 with V-Sync. RDR2, GTA5, and Wildlands play at smooth 60 with V-Sync.

### Programming & The Keyboard

Keyboard still works fine. I actually still have the Logi MX Ergo I bought at the same time I got this G14, and the LMB on it is already janky. Have had zero issues with this keyboard, and can actually type at 92 wpm now compared to the 73 wpm right after I first started learning the smaller keyboard.
