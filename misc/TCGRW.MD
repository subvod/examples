# INFORMATION

This is a collection of mostly factual data taken during and after testing many aspects of the game. I say "mostly" because there are some parts where I've made claims with purely anecdotal evidence, but I make that clear where it's applicable.

# GENERAL GAMEPLAY

### Quick Tips

<ul>
  <li>Unlock and equip the <b>M203GL</b> (grenade launcher) via <b>Skills</b> as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>Complete the two missions in the `Operation Archangel` strand in <b>Libertad</b> for the <b>Caviera Gloves</b>.</li>
  <li>Complete the two missions in the `Operation Silent Spade` strand in <b>Media Luna</b> and <b>Barvechos</b> for the <b>Optical Camo</b> (backpack).</li>
  <li><b>Intel</b> is most common in large towns and enemy bases.</li>
  <li><b>Flashbangs</b> blind all occupants of a vehicle.</li>
  <li>You regenerate health after not receiving damage for a short time.</li>
  <li>Explosive damage doesn't penetrate solid surfaces, but explosive force does. This means that gate locks blow off, windows shatter, boxes get destroyed, etc.</li>
  <li>You start out with the <b>P416</b>, <b>MP5</b>, and <b>P45T</b>. Ghost mode only allows one primary, so you'll only have the <b>P416</b> and <b>P45T</b> by default.</li>
  <li><b>Weapon Cases</b> and <b>Accessory Cases</b> can be found around the entire map. Special guns can be obtained by completing certain missions. Most guns have their own unique stats. See [Weapon Stats] for more info.</li>
</ul>

### Noise Detection Ranges

All weapon classes have their own noise detection with no difference between weapons of the same class despite what the "noise reduction" bar may show. Compensators do not affect noise, again despite what the stat bar shows. Below are the maximum distances at which gunfire is heard by an enemy NPC. This is a flat number, no variables change noise detection distance. For example, an enemy will hear your unsuppressed MP5 at 60m, but if you take a mere one step backwards he won't hear a thing at 61m.

</table>

<sub><b>[1]</b></sub> The <b>Compensator</b> does not affect loudness, despite showing that it decreases the <b>Noise Reduction</b> stat.

### Visual Detection Ranges

<ul>
  <li>Time of day plays a part in visual detection distance (lighting in general does). Ubisoft ported a Splinter Cell system of sorts. It allows for variable detection speed based on player stance and light level. Dark areas reveal less therefore you get spotted slower in the shadows. Opposite goes for broad daylight in an open field with no brush.</li>
  <li>Bushes act as concealment for all players but not NPCs. You can mark an enemy hiding behind a bush, but they cannot see you hiding behind the same bush.</li>
  <li>Enemies will also not see you behind any sort of solid cover. However you can get spotted hiding behind what may appear to be solid cover. Things like boxes and metal dolleys, basically everything that you can move by just walking into it, is not cover nor concealment despite its solid appearance. The game engine treats all moveable objects as simply that and no more.</li>
</ul>

Below are the ranges at which enemies begin to spot the player. These were tested in barren, unobscured conditions (no cover/concealment blocking view) against both <b>SBC</b> and <b>Unidad</b> forces at <b>Koani Air Base, Koani</b> and <b>F.O.B. Serpiente, Flor de Oro</b>. No spotting distance differences were found between factions nor solider types (unarmored, vested, veteran, heavy). Snipers are the only NPC type which has altered sight distances, rightfully so. All of that into account, apparently Unidad is no more elite than some cokeheads with guns.

### Tactical Items

- You start out with just <b>Frag Grenades</b>, but can unlock others via the <b>Skill Tree</b>.
- The <b>Explosion Radius</b> elite perk from the <b>Items Skill Tree</b> is stupid useful.
- <b>Generators</b> can be found pretty much everywhere, show up hot on thermal, and explode when hit by an <b>EMP Drone</b> or multiple bullets.
- <b>Red Barrels</b> can be found in fortified bases, <i>don't</i> show up on thermal, and explode from a single shot.

Not to mention div lures do not alert affected enemies and you get way more of them. Use div lures to make enemies face a certain direction, ideally away from you, then run up behind them and melee. This saves on ammo and doesn't alert them directly unlike flashbangs. You can also use div lures (or just shoot at some spot close to an enemy) to get them to face and walk towards a body you don't want them to find. This makes luring enemies out into the open stupid easy.</li>

### Documents

Documents, recordings, photos, collectibles, and Kingslayer Files can be found all around the map and usually give context of or lore about the area they're found in.

### Skills and Resources

- <b>Perks</b> are unlocked on <b>Skill Trees</b>. After unlocking at least one bar in each perk of a <b>Skill Tree</b>, you'll unlock the <b>Elite Perk</b> of that tree. These <b>Elite Perks</b> are very useful.
- <b>Skill Points</b> are used to unlock/upgrade perks. They can be found at various spots around the map, but are more common in hotter areas where conflicts with enemies are more likely to occur.
- <b>Resources</b> are used to unlock/upgrade perks in the <b>Skill Tree</b>. There are four resource types: meds, food, fuel, and comms. Each resource has its own <b>Supply Drop/Convoy</b> vehicles and/or color schemes.
- <b>Bonus Medals</b> act as an additional upgrade to a perk. If a perk in the <b>Skill Tree</b> has a star at the bottom right corner, it has a bonus medal. Highlight the perk to see the province its bonus medal is located in.

Small pickups from COM containers, petrol barrels, provision boxes, etc, are only worth it for the first few ranks of a new game. It's best to hit a convoy if you need resources.

Basically, the most efficient method is to run a low tier profile in single player <b>Guerilla Mode</b>. You get hundreds of thousands of resources from a completed 25-wave game. To make it easy, wait until the last few enemies are automatically marked. Use sync shot to take off remaining enemies, leaving at least one. Run to him, grab him, turn on your tier mode, and then knock him out. Not only do you get tons of resources every fifth wave, tier mode also yields way more "scrap" used for buying weapons, attachments, skills, etc. This gives 600,000 resources (of varying types) in one 25-wave run through.

For convoy takedowns, the <b>EMP Drone</b> is hit or miss from my experience, especially if you EMP the main vehicle when it's traveling on even the slightest downhill strech. They'll just coast down and move on when the engine starts back up. The most effective method proven from testing is using sync shot for the driver and passenger, then a one-shot weapon for the escort vehicles (SR25 Jungle or Desert Tech HTI BDC). Second most effective is flashbang, then take out the driver and passenger yourself by shooting through the side window(s). Yes, flashbanging enemies inside vehicles works. Third most effective is the makeshift claymore method, setting a mine, then C4s in a backwards direction. This ensures the front vehicle sets off the initial explosion, which travels backwards and subsequently destroys all vehicles in the convoy (except for a heli if it has one). This method destroys the truck itself, halving the yield, therefore it's listed as the least effective.

### Rebel Support

- These can be very helpful when in a pinch. Each skill is upgraded by completing an associated <b>Rebel Ops</b> mission.
- Completing <b>Rebel Ops</b> and <b>Supply Drop</b> missions increases Rebel presence. Completing all of each mission type will result in roads filled with Rebels ready to back you in the next firefight.

# ENEMY AI

[Reference.](https://youtu.be/SCh0uD8FZ18)

There are five (5) alert states which enemies of any faction can be in. The icon above enemies which have no alert status will not blink. At "Suspected" and "Hunted", the icon will begin to blink slowly. At "Engaged" status, the icon blinks rapidly. The "Hunted" stage is broken into two separate stages despite what's shown above the minimap, but the rate of icon blinking is the same between the two.

Lots and lots of cocaine.)</td>

	<td class="tdleft"><b>Whose footprints are these?</b><br><br>Enemies are aware of a threat's presence and general area. They move into combat positions and rush the player. Hostiles take considerably more damage in this stage. If enemies (the players and AI teammates) are known to be out of range, reinforcement vehicles will be sent in. Only Santa Blanca sends in reinforcement vehicles. If the player is near a road, ground vehicles will be sent out. Otherwise, a helicopter will be sent. The only time Unidad will send in vehicles is if the player has alerted Unidad patrols anywhere from one to four purple chevrons. (Alerts are triggered when any nearby Unidad NPC is pushed into Hunted Stage 2.)</td>

This alert status is only pushed by visual detection, and can only be lost by either breaking visual contact or killing all alerted enemies in the area. Hostiles take slightly more damage than in "Hunted Stage 2". From "Engaged" status, after breaking visual contact with the enemy, you will move down into Hunted II. The enemies will move to your last known location, search the area, and upon nothing being found return to "Normal".</td>

<sub><b>[1]</b></sub> <i>These seem to be very rare NPCs. Can be found sparsely around the map at spots labeled <b>Rebel Campsite</b>.</i>

- Campsites/checkpoints are randomly populated by Cartel/Unidad/Rebel forces, anywhere from 2 to 4 of each type. Sometimes these campsites will have two or three factions, meaning one day you might pass it with just two cartel gunners while the next may have both Unidad and rebels. Population conditions are unknown. There is a special type of campsite spawn where it appears the cartel and Unidad are negotiating. In this scenario, there will be a Santa Blanca Veteran along with two Santa Blanca Soldiers and an Unidad Veteran with two Unidad Soldiers.

### Road Patrols

Below is data taken from observing road patrol vehicles in the full game and both DLCs. Unidad road patrols and cartel reinforcement vehicles' occupants may vary based on location, e.g. more difficult provinces will have more heavies and veterans (and more occupants in general). A Unidad 4x4 in Itacua will have two soldiers, a driver and gunner, while the same vehicle in Koani may be loaded down with four heavies. Exceptions to this rule (those with occupants which do not vary based on location) are marked with an asterisk.

# GAME MODES

<i>Some info on different modes.</i>

### Tier Mode

You unlock Tier Mode by reaching level 30. After turning it on, you start at tier 50 and work your way down to tier 1. You get rewards of prestige credits and resources after unlocking each tier all the way to tier 1, with the final reward being 10 times the normal reward given for all prior 49 tiers. Additionally, you get cosmetic and weapon rewards: Jaws mask, Wingnut helmet, Red Shemagh, Operator mask, Desert Tech HTI BDC, and LVOA-C Bad News. As you crawl down each tier enemies have more health/armor and spot you more quickly. What that really means is at tier 1 you barely have time to react to being spotted. Your weapons also do less damage unless you upgrade them. Every weapon starts at level 1 and maxes out at level 30. <u>Be aware a level 30 gun in tier mode is essentially what it is outside of tier mode.</u>

### Ghost Mode

Permadeath. Sounds fun, right? I'll give the quick run-down of Ghost Mode: prepare your asshole. You get one primary weapon slot and one sidearm slot, use them wisely. Ghost Mode also has Tier Mode within it. Also, you get the exoskeleton pieces in Ghost Mode. See Ghost Mode Speedrun for recommendations on busting through for the gold exoskeleton suit.

### Guerilla Mode

This is a survival game mode which rewards you with Prestige Credits and Resources every fifth wave up to 25 waves. Rewards double after each "raid" (group of five waves). Resource types vary by randomization. You choose an existing gamesave slot to use and begin on Wave 1. There is an intermission period between each wave. During this intermission, a shopkeep opens up and the player is able to purchase weapons, attachments, consumables (grenades, flashbangs, mines, etc), skills, and bonus medals with "scrap" obtained by getting kills and completing waves. The shop closes when the intermission period ends and the next wave begins, and remains closed for the duration of the wave while active. Most items in the shop are randomized each game and may include DLC weapons. Upon completing (the 25th and final wave of) Guerilla Mode for the first time, players receive an exclusive shirt and pants combo, labelled as the "Survivor" set. These can only be obtained by completing Guerilla Mode. Additionally, Prestige Credits rewards repeat, meaning every 25-wave game will yield 500 prestige credits.

Guerilla Mode can be used in conjunction with Tier Mode. Multipliers carry over to tier points, kill/completion scrap, and resource rewards. A tier one player can make a heap of resources in a full 25-wave run. The stats below were taken from a full 25-wave run with tier mode (tier one) on for every fifth wave. If you somehow managed to roll the same resource for all raids, you can make up to 855,600 resources of any given type.

# VEHICLE STATS

### Vehicle Armor

Below are armor testing results and information on vehicles available in the game.

# WEAPON STATS

### Paint Wear

Guns will wear down over time. It's purely visual, performance is not affected by this. Gun wear is per gun, not per paint. Therefore, you can switch paints while retaining the gun's wear. You can reset a gun's wear to "clean" it, making the paint all sparkly, clear, and new. I haven't found any specific way to get a gun to wear quickly.

<i>Stuff I've observed so far:</i>

- Hits on peds, vehicles, and defense systems (SAMs, jammers, etc) that haven't been blown up seem to be the only hits that count towards gun wear. Shots that don't hit anything which can take damage are disregarded.
- Just having the gun equipped contributes to wear, albeit at a slower rate than actually using it.
- Seems like there are four stages of visual gun wear. The next stage is pushed every 20 kills.

### Scopes/Optics

Technically speaking, it's more personal preference rather than testable statistics. Despite logic (being more accurate simply by using your preferred optic), optics directly affect accuracy and shot groupings (accordingly to what's shown on the stats page, which is one of the few accurate depictions of performance changes). This means that any assault rifle will have the closest shot groupings with the <b>TA31H</b> attached. Same goes for all weapons of all classes with all optics.

- The <b>G33</b> magnifier widens shot groupings, so be aware of that. It works decent on all compatible optics, but the <b>Micro T1</b> dot becomes a red blob when magnified. (Makes it harder to pinpoint exactly where I'm aiming especially past 150m.)
- The <b>Micro-T1</b> by itself isn't terrible for CQB, but if you can't deal with the tiny sight and tendency for glare you're likely better off with the <b>CompM4</b>.
- The <b>CompM4</b> is the only optic (aside from the <b>TA31H</b> to some extent) that eliminates the lens glare that all other optics exhibit in certain lighting. Its dot is <b>always zero'd properly</b> across all guns (to my knowledge), unlike the <b>Micro T1</b>.
- The <b>Digital Scope</b>, <b>TA31H</b>, <b>Russian Red Dot</b>, and <b>Micro T-1</b> (with and without <b>G33</b> magnifier) are <b>improperly zero'd</b> on all weapons. (I.e. they don't hit dead center on the dot. Usually a bit to the right most of the time, if not much farther down than center dot.)
- The <b>CompM4</b>, <b>Panoramic Sight</b>, <b>EXPS3</b>, and <b>PK-AS</b> are <b>always properly zeroed</b> on the center dot on every weapon.
- The <b>Panoramic Sight</b> has the lowest parallax and least sight picture interference, as well as a larger and more defined reticle than the <b>EXPS3</b>.

For sniper optics, same thing: personal preference.

- Technically, snipers and DMRs are less affected by accuracy as they're generally used in semi-auto or are bolt action.
- The <b>T5Xi</b> can be offset quite a bit on certain weapons, but provides the best accuracy and highest zoom.
- The <b>POSP</b> and <b>TARS101</b> are widely reliable on all sniper rifles, though their offset zeros are worse on a few.
- The <b>G28</b> offers a 5.0x scope similar to the <b>T5Xi</b> with an alternate 1.0x red dot (<b>Micro T-1</b>) for quick change to CQB. The reticle is zero'd on the <b>Micro T-1</b> red dot rather than the center crosshair on the high magnification scope below it. It essentially zeroes the weapon out even farther, and this is generally regarded as the most utilitarian sniper scope. I personally recommend the <b>G28</b> for sniping much in the same way many other people do, but also regularly use the <b>TARS101</b> simply because of the little flappy lens caps. (And comparable zoom levels with minimal accuracy loss.)

### The Best Loadout

Statistically speaking, the best loadout in vanilla Wildlands (the stock version of the game excluding DLCs and crate unlocks) for covering all ranges is: <b>M4A1</b>, <b>HTI</b>, and <b>Lady Killer</b>.

					</li>
					<li>
						Lowest potential TTK among assault rifles.
					</li>
					<li>
						An <b>M4A1</b> with <b>burst trigger</b> against a <b>Unidad/Santa Blanca heavy</b> is where it falls behind. Not enough to significantly tank its ranking. It remains the best all-around weapon in general.
					</li>
					<li>
						By default, the <b>AK-12</b> and <b>G36C</b> with the <b>standard barrel</b> and <b>burst trigger</b> will take down any enemy in a single burst of three (via burst trigger).
					</li>
					<li>
						An <b>M4A1</b> with <b>long barrel</b> gains the single burst kill potential the <b>AK-12</b> and <b>G36C</b> inherently have with their <b>standard barrel</b>. The <b>long barrel</b> and <b>50-round magazine</b> do affect handling, and the drop in ADS time and movement speed is noticeable.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can go from nice and quiet to loud and proud without changing weapons and still remain just as effective.

					<li>
						Easy to control with soft and manageable recoil (even with the <b>long barrel</b> and <b>stock muzzle</b>).

DLC weapons which perform better than the aforementioned are: <b>416</b>, <b>BFG-50A</b>, and <b>Five-seveN Blacklist</b>.

- <b>416</b> is an M4A1 without a <b>Burst Trigger</b>.
- <b>BFG-50A</b> <i>or</i> <b>Desert Tech HTI BDC</b> <i>or</i> <b>SR25 Jungle</b>. It's hard to argue for <b>HTI BDC</b> when the <b>BFG</b> is just a semi auto <b>HTI</b>. To be fair, the <b>HTI BDC</b> has less bullet drop, but the <b>Jungle</b> has a 20-round mag, is semi-auto, shoots flat out to 350m, and holds one-shot capability to everything. The <b>SR25 Jungle</b> is basically a combination of <b>HTI BDC</b> damage but shoots faster and flatter than the <b>BFG-50A</b>.
- <b>Five-seveN Blacklist</b> has high damage and velocity, but also doesn't alert enemies. (Similar to the <b>Whisper</b>, but it has the absolute lowest damage of any weapon in the game.)

Therefore the statistical best loadout including DLC weapons is: <b>416</b>, <b>SR25 Jungle</b>, and <b>Five-seveN Blacklist</b>.

And here's some honorable mentions:

Gun | Class | Details
:--- | --- | ---
Mk 16<br>Mk 17<br>R5 RGP | Assault Rifle | Low fire rate, high damage, high recoil. Very useful for early game when <b>VHC Destruction</b> skill hasn't been purchased.<ul><li><b>Mk 16</b> is the <b>Mk 17</b>, but with a bit less recoil and faster reload.</li><li><b>Mk 17</b> is high damage, but slow reload.</li><li><b>R5 RGP</b> is the <b>Mk 16</b> in an AR15 package.</ul>
AK-12<br>G36C | Assault Rifle | Performs similarly to <b>M4A1</b>.
BFG-50A | Sniper Rifle | A semi auto <b>HTI</b> with slightly less bullet drop.
MSR | Sniper Rifle | The best balanced sniper rifle. 10-round magazine capacity, guaranteed one-shot kill to personnel (with long barrel), two-shots helicopters, and manageable bullet drop (not the best but definitely not the worst).
M40A5 | Sniper Rifle | One shots when equipped with Long Barrel. Requires some skill to use effectively.
Vector .45 ACP<br>Scorpion EVO 3 | Submachine Gun | <i>beware the beez</i>
SR-635 | Submachine Gun | Crazy damage and fast reload, but bullets drop off hard.
Mk 48<br>Mk 249 | Light Machine Gun | Balanced LMGs with higher-than-normal rates of fire and manageable recoil.
M60E4 | Light Machine Gun | Crazy damage, but wack recoil.
SASG-12<br>SILENCIO | Shotgun | <i>haha suppressed auto shotty go sploosh sploosh sploosh</i>
RevSG-12 | Shotgun | Breakover action revolver shotgun with a stupid fast reload.
M9 | Pistol | Highest damage customizable pistol in the game.

### Critical Hit Mechanics

A critical hit deals double the damage of a regular round fired from a weapon. After extensive gameplay, the way the game appears to calculate critical hit chance is dependent upon four factors: shots fired, length of burst, shot placement, and target proximity. I say four because any weapon (outside of Tier Mode and other than the Whisper pistol) will always one-shot unalerted enemies regardless of armor level. The game appears to just automatically kick the damage booster to well over 100% so as to guarantee a one-shot kill. Headshots work in this same manner. That being the case, analysis results will be based on experience with alerted enemies, specifically and exclusively regular Unidad soldiers (not heavy machine gunners or veterans).

The game does appear to have a "damage drop over distance" mechanic, or something that could be perceived as such. It also (sort of) parallels the way damage range works in Call of Duty: the farther your bullet goes the less damage it deals, meaning it will take more rounds to kill an enemy at longer ranges than the same weapon against the same enemy at shorter ranges. Less chance of a crit means you must rely on your weapon's base, raw damage. Weapons with a lower damage-per-round are rendered virtually ineffective at distances over 200m. Even some sniper rifles, ahem cough <b>G28</b>, lose out from a distance (since the goal of using a sniper rifle should be to kill in one shot rather than, say six) <i>again erm cough <b>G28</b> and <b>Mk 14</b> cough cough</i>. The critical hit damage multiplier is also lowered over distance. Meaning not only do you have a lower chance of landing a crit, even if you land a lucky crit it may as well have been a regular hit.

<b><u>Balancing For Critical Hits:</u></b> High rate of fire means a higher chance of landing a critical hit. Most weapons with a low rate of fire have higher base damage compared to other weapons in their class to compensate for the lower rate of fire (thus lower chance of critting). However, as far as balancing goes, the <b>M4A1</b> is about as good as it gets when it comes to "the best of both worlds". Closely ranked competitors are the <b>AK-12</b> and <b>G36C</b>.

### Shotguns

It's rather difficult to test shotgun damage and maintain control of consistency. Shotgun damage tests on soft targets were done the same as every other weapon, up close and personal, to ensure no excess of rogue variables. Within 10m, all shotguns' spread remains in an area small enough to keep track of how many shells are fired. Past a certain distance (varying from shotgun to shotgun) the spread progressively widens, making farther shots difficult to record.

Below are test results for maximum shotgun ranges with all available barrels. Distances listed are 1m less than when all pellets lose substance. Ideally, the maximum range is 1m to 2m less than what is listed here as at these distances a mere one (1) pellet will land somewhere near where you shot. Since shot spread is randomly generated, you're always rolling the dice at landing a hit at these ranges. Moving in 1m or 2m ensures all pellets retain substance and hit the target.

### Damage Stats

<ul>
  <li>All testing was done in a <b>115%</b> complete save (with <i>everything</i> done) on <b>Extreme</b> Difficulty with <b>Tier Mode</b> off. All <b>Skills</b> purchased. All <b>Weapons</b> and <b>Attachments</b> collected/owned. All <b>Main Story</b> and <b>Rebel Support</b> missions completed. Yada yada yada.</li>
  <li>"Special weapons" are the guns that cannot be edited in the <b>Gunsmith</b> menu. Take note that the name of the weapon doesn't indicate it operates the same way its stock counterpart does. Differences may include bullet drop, base damage, rate of fire, reload speed, etc. For example, the <b>P416 Micteca</b> operates as if it were an <b>M4A1</b>, while the <b>M4A1 Temple</b> operates as if it were an <b>M16</b>.</li>
  <li>Weapons had no attachments other than barrel modifications listed.</li>
  <li>Any weapon/barrel configuration listed as `INV` is rendered virtually ineffective against hard targets, i.e. an APC will take upwards of 200+ shots, realistically invulnerable to damage from that configuration.</li>
  <li>Range values below sidearms' names are tested maximums and listed as 1m below the distance at which the bullet loses substance (is no longer considered a shot by the game).</li>
  <li>Hard target (vehicle) tests were conducted at <b>Koani Bravo</b> against a player-spawned <b>Unidad APC</b>. For sidearms, hard target values are shots taken to destroy a <b>Pickup</b>.</li>
  <li>All soft target testing was done at <b>M.O.B. Jaguar, Flor de Oro</b> against a regular <b>Unidad Solider</b> (not heavy or veteran). All soft targets were taken out within "Engaged" status at point blank range (within 10m). Base damage values were recorded using semi-auto trigger with any weapon where it was available, otherwise full auto was used in a one-round burst fashion if a weapon did not offer a semi-auto trigger configuration. Shots taken were center-mass and kept above the waistline but below the neck. Kills involving any sort of critical hit were disregarded to avoid inflating the numbers.</li>
  <li>Soft target "burst potential" is the number of shots taken in a full auto burst. All burst tests start at the highest ROF trigger (three round burst). If a 3RB trigger wasn't available, full auto was used. If the only firing mode available is semi-auto, the weapon was fired as quickly as possible. For all weapons, aim down sight target lock-on assistance was used and firing began right after full ADS (scope in). Only targets that ate the entire burst were counted, all others were disregarded. Same as flat damage values, kills involving critical hits were disregarded as well.</li>
  <li>Sniper rifle "burst potential" was tested in two ways to ensure accuracy: shooting the feet and shooting the chest. If a sniper rifle has '1' in the "soft target" column, it will one-shot even in the foot. Otherwise, the maximum number of shots taken to the foot was listed. Some sniper rifles (such as the <b>M40A5</b> and all sniper rifles chambered in <b>.338LM</b>) may one-shot center mass, but require two shots on extremeties. These individual differences were not recorded, as the <b>MSR</b> (with a long barrel) is the only <b>.338LM</b> rifle which kills in one shot regardless of shot placement. For bolt actions, the least number of chest shots taken. (This is to show possible discrepancies between different hitboxes.)</li>
  <li>Each weapon class has its own penetration, as in they're guaranteed to shoot through certain surfaces. Some weapons penetrate more surfaces than others, as in one may go through a sandbag while another of the same class may not. For the most part, almost all weapons of a class will penetrate the same surface types and layers. Weapon penetration (both statistical and as shown in-game) appears to have no effect on armored personnel targets.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>QUICK NOTE ABOUT SNIPER DAMAGE AT RANGE:</u></b> I've been able to reproduce a strange event where my <b>HTI</b> (yes, with long barrel) doesn't one shot <b>beyond 400m</b>. I have no clue why this happens as it seems to come in and out at random. What I mean by "reproduce" is that I've had it happen a number of times in different spots. Twice from the cliff overlooking <b>M.O.B. Condor, Media Luna</b>, once at <b>La Carcel del Pueblo, San Mateo</b>, and twice at the <b>Koani Air Base, Koani</b>.

### Sniper Rifle Bullet Drop

![image](https://i.imgur.com/VIGR8bC.jpg)

[Link to image above.](https://i.imgur.com/VIGR8bC.jpg)

This list is in descending order, with the highest hitting (least bullet drop) rifles at the top and lowest hitting (most bullet drop) rifles at the bottom. Each cell acts as its own drop rate, meaning all weapons within a row have either the exact same bullet drop or the difference between the weapons in the group was so minor that it could be attributed to breath movement/sway while aiming. All tests were conducted at <b>M.O.B. Condor, Media Luna</b> on the airstrip section at 300m. All rifles were set up with the <b>TARS101</b> scope, longest applicable barrel, and no suppressor. Shots were fired at the bottom of each breath sway.

<b><u>DISCLAIMER:</u></b> YouTube creator [DarkDally](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ujGmsso9_IyYRj7PUjHkg) and many others have noted the scope zeroing differences between scopes and rifles. You can [watch his testing on YouTube](https://youtu.be/t30kui923dQ?t=944). In an effort to ensure the most accurate data is recorded, markers were not used to zero the shots. Instead, rifle after rifle, the shot was scoped in to the exact same place the previous shot was, otherwise known as not moving the thumbsticks. This prevents misalignment due to camera movement and ensures every shot is taken at the exact same location regardless of where the rifle is zeroed with any optic. The original idea for this came from noting how every weapon is dead zero on the in-game crosshair (in third person). The crosshair placement might be skewed while aiming down sights, but the gun will not shoot skewed from the game's crosshair.

# FAQ

<i>Faq, glitches and easter eggs.</i> <b>SPOILERS AHEAD!</b>

### Ghost Mode speedrun for Gold Exoskeleton suit?

- The fastest and easiest way to go about getting the gold exo is to run a tier point grinding route. You can view the number of <b>Tier Points</b> a mission yields by selecting it either from the map or via <b>Mission Replay</b>. The most efficient missions are those in <b>Inca Camina</b>, <b>Koani</b>, <b>Flor de Oro</b>, <b>Libertad</b>, <b>Malca</b>, and <b>Espiritu Santo</b>.
- You can essentially use any weapon you choose, but as listed above some are statistically better than others. If when you start out you die often, it's best to use a weapon that is preconfigured with usable attachments, namely the <b>M203 GL</b>. Not only is it super overpowered in this game, you can use it despite not having the skill unlocked after restarting a new save with certain weapons. These are: <b>M16</b> (from Predator DLC pack), <b>556xi Dragon</b> (from Fallen Ghosts weapons DLC pack), and <b>P416 Micteca</b> (from Prestige Crates). <b>Ritmo</b> obtained from DJ Perico and the <b>LVOA-C Bad News</b> have the <b>M203 GL</b> but are unlocked with further progression, limiting their initial use.) I personally recommend the <b>P416 Micteca</b> as it is just an <b>M4A1</b>. Next in line is the <b>M16</b> which operates in the same manner with a lower rate of fire. The <b>556xi Dragon</b> has a compensator and therefore isn't mega useful when stealthing, but is fantastic for big firefights.
- If you run the route effectively, you can get the gold exo suit rather quickly. I flew through the storyline and ground out to tier 1 in about 48 hours. Granted, this was after 15 attempts and about six months of prior play. Two saves I lost were under tier 10, one at tier 8 and another at tier 6. A lot of the others were between tier 40 and 20, dying from explosions and such.

### How does the Optical Camo backpack work?

[Reference.](https://redd.it/14061rd)

A common misconception of the Optical Camo backpack (from completing both parts of `Operation Silent Spade`) is that it reduces the distance at which you're detected. What it actually does is reduce the speed at which you're detected rather than the distance.

### Optical Camo backpack makes me just a floating balaclava.

The Optical Camo backpack is incompatible with a select few cosmetic items. Certain footwear and head/facewear will cause some pieces of clothing to be visible even when cloaked. Switching around a few items usually fixes this issue.

### How to beat The Predator?

<b><u>NOTE:</u></b> The Predator mission, <b>The Jungle Moved</b>, was removed from the game in 2022 due to trademarks expiring. The <b>Predator Biomask</b> can still be kept as long as you obtained it in a savegame prior to the mission being removed. The <b>Predator Helmet</b> is still for sale in the in-game store as well. This is all the more reason to use a cracked version of the game with a completionist savegame having all the items.

This is rather simple. Grab your M4 and max out your "Guns for Hire" and "Diversion" rebel support skills. After that, go to the Predator's mission location, talk to the lady, investigate the locations, and move to the final waypoint. <b>BEFORE YOU ENTER THE CIRCLE TO START THE FINAL STAGE</b>, call in your rebels. The reason they are so important, or rather not, is because they'll act as bait. The Predator will lock onto them rather than you and your teammates, opening up more opportunities to fire upon it.

The Predator itself does not have a definite health amount. Rather, he has a hit counter. Now... ideally if you're looking for numbers, drop your <b>M4A1</b> for a <b>Scorpion EVO 3</b>. Higher rate of fire means you reach that hit counter faster. Do not attempt to shoot the Predator if you see him running around while cloaked. Hits landed in that stage do not count towards the total, for some reason. If you are locked onto, take cover <b>only if you know for sure you're covered.</b> The Predator's gun has radial damage because it is, indeed, an explosion. I recommend moving about more than taking cover. Why? Once you get the timing down you can dodge his shots with ease, much in the same way you dodge SAMs in an aircraft. The Predator's lasers track the target, so you could be running just around the corner of a tree and the laser will curve with you. My dodging strategy hasn't changed since I first got it down: as soon as you're locked onto, sprint in a straight line either directly towards or away from the Predator. When you hear him fire his laser thing, judge the length of time it will take for it to reach you (based on distance from him i.e. how loud the laser firing is). At just over &frac78; of that time, turn right or left to dodge.

Once you get that strategy down, you're golden. The Predator will become easier and easier the more you practice it.

### Beat General Baro easily.

Having trouble taking General Baro? Plant yourself just outside of the mission circle (after talking to his daughter).

<ol>
	<li>
		Fire a round near him to alert him. This will cause him to run the same way a lietenant does.
	<li>
		Sometimes a truck will spawn in front of the barn opening, which blocks his path outwards. To fix this, either wait until he runs around the truck, or shoot it until it explodes. In the latter case, he will dodge the explosion (most of the time, sometimes it'll kill him).
	</li>
	<li>
		Wait until he runs close to you <u>and outside of the circle</u>. The reason he needs to be outside of the circle is to avoid triggering the Unidad spawn. Grab him, stow him (preferably in a heli), and fly through the circle to trigger the checkpoint and Unidad spawn. Fly all the way to the rally point and you're golden. Most of the time, the flight to the RP is long enough to lose the Unidad alert.
	</li>
</ol>

### Unique Melee Animations

The following have unique melee animations and sounds:

<ul>
  <li>Tank Top + Predator Wristblades (from `Predator DLC Pack`)</li>
  <li>Caviera Gloves (from `Operation Archangel` with Caviera)</li>
  <li>Echelon Gloves</li>
  <li>Executioner (from `Operation Oracle: Suspicion` with Walker)</li>
</ul>

### Caviera Gloves Automatic Marking

This is super useful if you play slow and quiet. Whenever a player makes a melee kill while wearing the <b>Caviera Gloves</b>, up to 4 enemies within the immediate area (inside the minimap) will be marked automatically. The melee animation is slower than others, but this ability is well worth the tradeoff.

### Special Vision Modes

There are several special vision modes available in Wildlands:

- Predator thermal vision mode can be accessed via the <b>Predator Biomask</b> (from `The Jungle Moved`) or <b>Predator Helmet</b> (from <b>Predator DLC Pack</b>).
- The desaturated (grayscale) night vision mode can be accessed via the <b>SONAR Goggles</b> (from `Challenge Items DLC Pack`).
- The Steiner night vision mode can be accessed by using a helmet with either the <b>Special NVG</b> or <b>Panoramic NVG</b> ocular types.

The items below do not give special vision modes:

<ul>
  <li>Monocular NVG</li>
  <li>FAST + Monoc. NVG</li>
  <li>High Cut + Monoc. NVG</li>
  <li>Advanced Ballistics Helmet</li>
  <li>Echelon Goggles</li>
  <li>Monocular Helmet</li>
  <li>Conviction NVG</li>
</ul>

### Keep NVG Flipped Down

[Reference.](https://youtu.be/8LN5ns7EPgo)

<ol>
  <li>Equip any cosmetic item with goggles.</li>
  <li>Turn on <b>Night Vision</b>.</li>
  <li>Equip an outfit without NVG/NODS.</li>
  <li>Turn off <b>Night Vision</b>.</li>
  <li>Equip the outfit with NVG/NODS.</li>
  <li>Enjoy having goggles flipped down without special vision modes.</li>
</ol>

### Crooked Optics

This is likely unintential on Ubisoft's part. Almost all optics shoot a tiny bit to the right of their center crosshair/dot. Some shoot a bit to the left and some shoot higher or lower (namely on select sniper rifles). The <b>EXPS3</b> and <b>Panoramic Sight</b> are properly zero'd on all guns.

### Ghost Mode Round in Chamber

While using certain guns, the player can switch weapons then switch back to the original to get a round in the chamber. This effect does not carry over after reload, however.

I've had this happen with the <b>MSR</b> and <b>Z93 AMR</b>, but don't know if it does the same for other snipers. Or guns in general, for that matter.

### Ghost Mode Full Loadout

- [Reference.](https://redd.it/anstgx)

While in Ghost Mode, the player may find that they have a second primary weapon on their back after messing about in the selection menu. The weapon will remain usable in that save and cannot be swapped afterwards. The weapon itself appears to be random.

Evidently this is caused by something early in game. Some have claimed it's something to do with picking up guns or doing something specific with an <b>Ammo Box</b>, but as for right now even I'm still uncertain.

> Maybe pick up a gun go to ammo box select a weapon then select another weapon. Or try to select the weapon you had picked up from enemy. IDK just an idea. I finished ghost mode so I don't play it. I pretty sure it has to happen at beginning of game or it not happen at all.

### M.O.B. Condor Full House

Numbers for this are listed in [NPC Population](#npc-population).

Before interacting with Scott Mitchell in the first part of `Operation: Silent Spade` the player can travel to the Condor Airbase in eastern <b>Media Luna</b> to engage a ton of Unidad soldiers (way more than usual). This happens in both the regular game and <b>Ghost Mode</b>. The game has individual NPC information for some specialized missions, such as animations for cutscenes, travel paths, clothing, voice lines, etc. This means as long as you don't trigger the mission by speaking with Scott Mitchell, tons of Unidad will remain at <b>M.O.B. Condor</b> indefinitely. Very convenient and quite fun when looking for a nice firefight.

This also works using mission replay.

### Bullet Sponge Enemies

When an enemy is mounted on a vehicle turret, they will take considerably more hits to kill. This is intentional. However the game treats the "cover" animations in the same manner. If you throw a grenade or send in mortars within close proximity to an enemy (same for hostile grenades and mortars) they will enter the "cover" animation, squatting down and covering their face.

### Mesh Glitch in ADS

While wearing some icon skins (Smoke, Kapkan, etc) and using certain weapons (M4A1, 416, etc.) with certain optics (CompM4, Digital Scope, TA31H, etc), the player may be able to see some parts of the character mesh while aiming down sight. Notable optics which resolve this (still unfixed) issue are the Panoramic Sight and EXPS3.

One gun I've seen zero clipping issues with is the <b>Mk 16</b>.

There's a random owl on a dead tree on the edge of the map. The stump has targets placed around it, and the owl explodes if you shoot it.

### DON'T PRESS ME!

There are a few red buttons on wooden posts scattered around the map. They do cool things.

### Leap of Faith

Assassin's Creed reference at Nidia Flores Hacienda in <b>Barvechos</b>. One corner of the bell tower has an eagle perched on it. Below you will find the wheelbarrow of hay. It is not functional.

### Matrix Construct

There's a lone chair out in the middle of nowhere in the salt flats of <b>Koani</b>.

### Flaming Sword

Dark Souls reference. Found atop a hill near a Rebel campsite in northwest <b>Caimanes</b>.

### Nuevo Mundo

Southwesternmost landmark in <b>Inca Camina</b>. Based on Flight 571.

### Hitman Suit

Agent 47's black suit with red tie (from the <b>Hitman</b> games) can be found in the closet during Caveira's mission.

### Armored Dozers

Only found near the tracks north of <b>El Sueno's Mausoleum</b> and west of a Santa Blance base on the east edge of <b>San Mateo</b>. These aren't known to spawn elsewhere.

### Unique Dialogue

Some NPCs have unique voice lines.

- If you send your squad somewhere using the <b>GO TO</b> command then mark sync shots for them, their voice lines differ from those used when marking sync shots without sending your squad somewhere.
- Nomad has special voice lines when asking a <b>Rebel Lieutenant</b> for intel. I'm unsure as to what may cause this, but still keeping an eye out.

### EOL and Running Without UPlay/Steam

1. Buy a legit copy of the game to support the devs who made it. We wouldn't have so much DRM nonsense if more people actually payed for a game once in a while.
2. Grab [DODI's Repack from 1337x](https://1337x.to/torrent/5156942/Tom-Clancy-s-Ghost-Recon-Wildlands-Ultimate-Edition-v4792145-build-5948128-All-DLCs-MULTi16-From-33-2-GB-EMPRESS-DODI-Repack/). Other repacks work, but this one is the latest build and includes everything.
3. Read the instructions and install it.
4. (OPTIONAL) Download [Vlvpsh's Complete Save](https://www.nexusmods.com/ghostreconwildlands/mods/22), then read its instructions and install it. Someone's posted [more digestible instructions](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/11100793-grw-complete-save-game/?p=121912053) on the mod's page.
5. Play to your heart's content.
