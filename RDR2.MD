# SURVIVING IN THE WILDERNESS

You're better off with a horse, but it's certainly possible to survive on your own. It's pretty straightforward: kill and collect things, then eat said things. Some consumables provide greater benefit than others and/or are only available in certain regions. Meats must be cooked before consumption.

### Weather and Proper Attire

The game has dynamic weather and it will change based upon where you're at.

Weather | Effects | Location(s)
:--- | --- | ---
Clear (Sunny) | Mostly clear with a few clouds here and there. | Everywhere.
Overcast | Solid layer of cloud cover. | Everywhere except New Austin.
Rain | Visible rain. | Everywhere.
Thunder | Just lightning/thunder, no rain. | Everywhere.
Thunderstorm | Heavy rain with lightning and thunder. | Everywhere.
Hurricane | Strong wind and heavy rain. | State of Lemoyne<br>Heartlands, NH
Sleet | Freezing rain. Occasional gusts. | Big Valley, WE<bt>Heartlands, NH<br>Roanoke Ridge, NH
Blizzard (Whiteout) | High winds. Heavy snow. Super low visibility. | Northwestern portion of **Grizzlies West, AM** (high mountains).
Windy | Leaves and other animated particles flying around. Audible wind. Usually indicative of a storm ahead. | Everywhere.
Fog | Very low visibility. | Bayou Nwa, LE<br>Bluewater Marsh, LE<br>Roanoke Ridge, NH
Mist | Low visibility. More common in early mornings.
Dust Storm | Strong wind. Super low visibility.| All regions of **New Austin** except **Hennigan's Stead, NA**.

### Killing, Skinning, and Cooking

*NOTE: nothing grows up in the Northwestern snow-covered areas of Ambarino.*

- Cooked meats refill all cores. The amount of restoration changes according to meat type. Wild meats are widely readily available. When seasoned, these meats fully restore the core associated with the herb used. See [Advanced Survival](#advanced-survival) below.

Meat | Animal(s)

Stringy Meat | Armadillo<br>Badger<br>Bat<br>Beaver<br>Chipmunk<br>Coyote<br>Fox<br>Muskrat<br>Opossum<br>Raccoon<br>Rat<br>Skunk<br>Snake<br>Squirrel

**Gold Cores** are simply fortified (or "overcharged") cores and can be obtained by cooking and consuming appropriately seasoned **Big Game Meat** or buying a $5.00 meal from an establishment with a kitchen. (Honor does not affect the costs of meals.) The gold core lasts 24 in-game hours, disregarding detrimental effects such as taking damage or wearing an outfit inappropriate for the weather conditions.

**Horse Meal** yields both gold horse health and stamina cores for a full 24 hours in-game. The recipie pamphlet can be obtained in **Chapter 3** as a reward for Kieran's item request of Burdock Root. One Horse Meal crafted from three of each Beets and Hay. Bought from Stables costs $2.70 versus the $5.00 **Horse Care Package**. Reasonably cheaper than the latter even with high honor discounts. In the long run, it's well worth the time spent traveling to a Stable to stock up on both for making Horse Meal on-the-go.

**Special Horse Reviver** and **Horse Ointment** are the only alternative and only true "wilderness" methods of getting gold cores for your horse. They are not bad tradeoffs for **Horse Meal** as they require less (but more various) ingredients per batch. If you're keen on the "true wilderness" part of the game, go for these two. If you've got the time and money to head into town and stock up on **Beets** and **Hay** ($89.10 and one minute to get 99 of both from a Stable), **Horse Meal** holds the edge benefit/investment wise. *NOTE: HORSE OINTMENT DOES NOT CLEAN YOUR HORSE. YOU'LL STILL HAVE TO BRUSH IT IF IT GETS DIRTY.*

Item | Core | Recipie
:--- | --- | ---
Minty Big Game | Player Health | 1x Big Game Meat<br>1x Wild Mint
Oregano Big Game | Player Stamina | 1x Big Game Meat<br>1x Oregano
Thyme Big Game | Player Dead Eye | 1x Big Game Meat<br>1x Creeping Thyme
Special Horse Reviver | Horse Health | 2x Ginseng<br>2x Wild Carrot<br>2x Parasol Mushroom
Horse Ointment | Horse Stamina | 1x Sage<br>1x Common Bulrush<br>1x Yarrow

And the herbs needed:

Herb | Location(s)
:--- | ---
Wild Mint | Near lakes, ponds, rivers, etc. Water in general.
Oregano | Forests. Wooded areas.
Creeping Thyme | Open areas with direct sunlight.
Ginseng | Forests. Wooded areas. Usually directly under trees.
Wild Carrot | Pretty much everywhere.
Parasol Mushroom | All over New Austin, but primarily in well-drained soils.
Sage | **Hummingbird Sage** grows in forests. **Desert Sage** grows scattered around **Gaptooth Ridge, NA**. **Red Sage** grows only in **Rio Bravo, NA**.
Common Bulrush | Shorelines of virtually every body of water in the game.
Yarrow | Wide open areas. (SPOILER: The clue for the `American Dreams` mission in **Big Valley, WE** has six Yarrow within close proximity.)

- **Poison Arrows** are key when needing to study and/or fend off aggressive animals. Hitting anything with a Poison Arrow will cause it to flee, allowing you to study animals as they run away. You can achieve the same effect by landing a critical hit, but Poison Arrows remove the skill required to land such a hit. Even better: spent **Poison Arrows** retain the poison and can be recollected and reused, unlike **Poison Throwing Knives**.
- **Potent Predator/Herbivore Bait** can help quite a bit if you're a stealth hunter. The recipie pamphlets are given automatically after starting Chapter 2.

Item | Recipie
:--- | ---
Potent Predator Bait | 1x Gritty Fish Meat<br>1x Wintergreen Berry/Evergreen Huckleberry/Raspberry/Blackberry
Potent Herbivore Bait | 1x Vanilla Flower<br>1x Violet Snowdrop<br>1x Parasol Mushroom/Ram's Head/Bay Bolete/Chanterelle

- **Flight Feathers** are required for every "improved" arrow type and can be harvested from all flying birds.
- **Animal Fat** is required for **Explosive Rounds** (unlocked at beginning of **Chapter 2**) which are both fun to use and extremely useful when taking down legendary animals. **Canada Geese**, **Ducks** (not Loons), and **Beavers** are by far the best animals for this as they are plentiful in many areas across the map (north of New Austin), but **Boars/Pigs/Peccary** and **Bears** also yield animal fat. **Geese** and **Ducks** yield **Flight Feathers** (for all improved **Arrow** types) and **Animal Fat** while **Beavers** yield **Scent Glands** (for **Cover Scent Lotion**) and **Animal Fat**. *NOTE: A PRIME LOCATION FOR GEESE, DUCKS, AND BEAVERS IS OWANJILA.*
- **Wild Carrots** are the holy grail of horse upkeep. They grow everywhere. The **Carrots** bought from stables cannot be used in crafting recipes, but they provide the same benefits as **Wild Carrots**. If you buy provisions from a Stable, **Hay** is the far superior choice as it is the cheapest cost-per-benefit in terms of core restoration, but does not give as many bonding points per use.

### Animal Attacks

Some animals will charge and kill you, some will randomly charge and headbutt you, some will randomly charge and bite.

Animal(s) | Attack Type
:--- | ---
Grizzly Bear<br>Wolf | Warning, charge, kill.
Cougar<br>Panther | Charge, kill.
Alligator | Warning, charge, kill.
Bighorn Ram<br>Whitetail Buck<br>Bull Elk<br>Wild Boar<br>Collared Peccary<br>Ox<br>Bull<br>Alpine Goat<br>(Domestic) Pig | Charge, headbutt.
Raccoon<br>Muskrat<br>Beaver<br>Badger<br>Skunk | Charge, bite.
All land snakes. | Flee, warning, bite.

- All land **Snakes** will bite and envenomate you. You can cure both poison (from ingesting **Oleander Sage**) and venom (from snake bites) with a **Potent** or **Special Health Cure**. Alternatively, you can eat any **Ginseng** plant.

### Looting plants and skins from NPCs.

If you don't care about honor, some NPCs have a chance to be holding small animal skins (random quality and species). These are primarily hunters found out in the wilderness. An easy-to-spot event is a hunter placing a carcass on their horse. Fishing NPCs have the same property. Some less-random NPCs have a chance of holding 2-4 of a certain plant when looted:

NPC | Loot
:--- | ---
Butcher Creek Residents<br>Murphy Brood | Currant<br>Sage<br>Ginseng<br>Violet Snowdrop<br>Burdock Root
Night Folk<br>Skinner Brothers | Burdock Root

### Bed, Bath, and Beyond

Some businesses offer lodging, baths, table games, and/or dining. If a shop as two meals available, the less costly one will fully restore all cores while the more costly one will yield a gold health core. Completing the batch "minigame" (chore) will yield a gold stamina core.

### Honor And Benefits

Honor is measured by ranks -8 to +8 on a scale according to the total honor as an integer from -320 to +320. It affects some aspects of the game. Interaction dialog change levels are unverified, but the effect does occur.

**NOTE:** In Chapter 6, actions that affect honor have a multiplier of 1.5x. Use this to your advantage if you run low honor as Arthur but want the "high honor" ending.

Honor | Effect
:--- | ---
280 | 50% discount in all shops
240 | New outfits available in shops.
200 | 25% discount in all shops
120 | New outfits available in shops.
80 | 10% discount in all shops. Interaction dialog changes to "positive".
40 | When looting bodies, drop rates of potent tonics, restorative items, jewelry, and food is increased.
0 | When looting bodies, primarily obtain standard tonics, cheap jewelry, basic horse consumables, and used/opened alcohol and tobacco.
-40 | When looting bodies, drop rates of dead eye tonics, thrown weapons, alcohol, and tobacco are increased. Also receive more money and jewelry when looting lawmen.
-80 | Interaction dialog changes to "negative".
-280 | Ambient sounds within dead eye change.

# GENERAL TIPS AND TRICKS

### How many horses can I own?

Up to four horses can be stabled, with a fifth as a "temporary" horse anywhere outside of the Stable. Temporary horses will have a horse head icon (with no bit) on the main map and minimap. Your main (saddle) horse will have the same icon but with a bit and harness. When you reach bonding level 1 with a new horse, your temporary horse will despawn automatically if it's far enough away.

### How to tame wild horses?

After hopping on, hold the stick in the opposite direction of where the horse is turning. If it's turning left, hold LS to the right. It's turning right, hold LS to the left. The backwards and forwards movements aren't needed, just left to right.

### Testing tonics.

Testing **Potent Tonics** against their **Special** variants was done by sprinting or entering dead eye right after consuming the associated items. Time was clocked when the bar was fully used up and the gold core fully depleted.

**Stamina**
1. Oregano Big Game + Special Bitters
- 01:54:04
2. Oregano Big Game + Potent Bitters
- 01:42:87

**Dead Eye**
1. Thyme Big Game + Special Snake Oil
- 0:44:21
2. Thyme Big Game + Potent Snake Oil
- 0:41:68

As you can see, **Special Bitters** makes a bit of a difference, where as **Special Snake Oil** does fairly little in terms of better fortification. Overall, if you're short on materials, bought/crafted Potent tonics will do just fine in most situations.

### How to max weapon familiarity fast?

Yes, it's a thing and if you'd never seen it on the Compendium for each weapon you'd never know of it. Familiarity affects all stats, and the more familiar you are with a weapon, the better shot you become with it.

- Use dead eye to get headshots.
- If avoiding law and bounties, enemy hideouts refresh every few in-game days. The numerous Del Lobo hideouts in New Austin become accessible after Chapter 6.

### How to max bond horses fast?

- Food items have their own unique bonding point yields. Sugar Cubes give the most points, paralleling what some **Stable Owners** claim.
- Completing two horse races with at least one of the associated NPCs will both allow you to bond with your horse while spurring and (after winning the second race) gives a third bar of speed for your saddled horse. Traveling in cinematic mode gives bonding points after completing the second race; a great legitimate way to bond AFK.
- Leading your horse yields more bonding points per minute than anything else. The old rubber band trick works for this. CheatEngine64's speedhack also works wonders if you're rushing or just short on time.

1. Begin leading your horse.
2. Travel to the open fields of **The Heartlands**. Alternatively you can go to the plains west of Blackwater, but there are more snakes out that way. (Getting close to any aggressive animal will end the lead.)
3. Wrap a rubber band around your thumbstick and the end of either palm grip (depending on the length of the rubber band).
4. Do other things for a while. (About 20 minutes.)
5. Come back to your fully bonded horse.

- *BY DOING THIS, YOU'RE BASICALLY STILL IN-GAME, SO THE POSSIBILITY OF HOSTILITY FROM BOUNTY HUNTERS, BUSHWHACKERS, ROBBERS, AGGRESSIVE ANIMALS, ETC IS STILL PRESENT. MIGHT WANT TO PEEK AT THE SCREEN EVERY NOW AND THEN AND/OR KEEP AN EAR OUT.*
- *If on the PC version without a controller, you can use [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to simulate holding down the movement key(s).*

### Map Icons

- I used [this map](https://gtaforums.com/topic/968364-complete-map-with-all-discoverable-icons/) as a reference.
- Animal drawings are added when an animal is sighted in a specific area. It must be both studied and tracked at least once to add icons the the overworld map. The best thing to do is study and track everything you come across. Hell, I even kill everything I see because why not? Additional locations will be marked as animals are "sighted" (moving the crosshair to highlight them). Looking at animals through binoculars (after studying and tracking at least one to fill the compendium) is by far the most efficient way to populate the map with animal icons. Though, I personally just run around killing everything with **Poison Arrows**. :)
- Plant drawings are added when a plant is picked/eaten at least once in the immediate area of the icon. Best to pick everything you come across because spawning a plant with a trainer and picking it does not add the icon for some reason (unlike skinning/tracking animals).
- Point of interest, dreamcatcher, dinosaur bone, and rock carving locations are added when they are "investigated".
- All map icons do not change based on what character discovered them. The journal sketches do, though.

### How to trigger Camp Item Requests?

*Triggering Pearson's rabbit request to obtain the unique Scout Jacket:*

It's available from Ch.2 to Ch.6. Pearson will be drinking beer at his wagon's table. When you walk near him, it will only give a **Greet** prompt when the request is available for activation (like every other request). I ran around camp in Ch.2 for 15 minutes real time and never got the request (had full cores the whole time). I went to camp in Ch.3 after consuming Moonshine, Cocaine Gum, and Chewing Tobacco to completely deplete my cores and voila, requested right as I walk into camp! Maybe coincidental, I've no numbers for solid proof this works. But if it is just coincidence, it's one hell of a coincidence. Also tested in Ch. 2. Took about 20 minutes, but those 20 minutes are nothing compared to a few hours total spend entering/exiting camp to get him to spawn there. It's worth a shot. :)

*Triggering Dutch's pipe request:*

I have never been able to trigger it in Chapter 2. The earliest I've ever gotten it is right after starting Chapter 3. Dutch has been in the same animation and outfit in Chapter 2, but the prompt never came up like it did (properly) in Chapter 3.

### Alcohol strength and states.

Below is a list of alcohol values per item. Coped from [this Reddit post](https://redd.it/9s6qnk/). Values amount to "proof", and are the base values before any modifiers. Higher proof means drunk quicker. A value of `1.00` is "blackout drunk". The **Wolf's Heart Trinket** halves the effects of all alcohol.

State | Range
:--- | ---
Sober | 0.00 to 0.49
Tipsy | 0.50 to 0.74
Drunk | 0.75 to 0.99
Blackout | 1.00+

Name | Value
:--- | ---
Saloon Beer | 0.1
Saloon Whiskey | 0.1
Opened Guarma Rum | 0.1
Opened Fine Brandy | 0.1
Opened Gin | 0.1
Opened Kentucky Bourbon | 0.13
Guarma Rum | 0.17
Fine Brandy | 0.17
Gin | 0.17
Kentucky Bourbon | 0.25
Moonshine | 0.3
Whiskey Bottle | 0.4
Aged Pirate Rum | 0.5

### What's the best saddle?

Technically, the **Beaver Roping Saddle** is the "best" saddle solely in terms of game logic because it provides the highest **Stamina Regen** (same as **Panther** and **Rattlesnake** saddles) and **Health Core Drain** bonuses. My reasoning behind this is: horse health core drain intensifies when they're dirty. I don't brush my horse often, so a lot of times it's just dirty. That being the case, the occasional health core penalty is lowered that much more with the Beaver Saddle. If you often push your horse hard and brush it once in a while, the **Panther Trail Saddle** is more fit for you. All that said, even though the aforementioned are the "best" stat-wise, I occasionally use the **Alligator Ranch Cutter** or **Cougar McClelland** saddles on my **Sooty Buckskin Dutch Warmblood** just because they look better on it. The stats don't differ a ton between higher-end **Trapper** saddles, so I generally just match the saddle to the horse I'm using. **Panther Trail** looks damn good to me on an **Amber Champagne MFT**.

Name | HEALTH CORE<br>DRAIN | STAMINA CORE<br>DRAIN | STAMINA<br>DRAIN | STAMINA<br>REGEN
:--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Beaver Roping | -26% | -20% | -50% | +24%
Panther Trail | -20% | -26% | -50% | +24%
Rattlesnake Vaquero | -22% | -24% | -50% | +24%
Alligator Ranch Cutter | -24% | -20% | -50% | +22%
Bear Dakota | -20% | -24% | -50% | +22%
Cougar McClelland | -20% | -22% | -50% | +20%
Boar Mother Hubbard | -22% | -20% | -50% | +20%
Nuevo Paraiso | -12% | -12% | -25% | +12%

### Traveling long distances automatically.

Aside from fast travel (unlocked by purchasing the map from the camp ledger), you can autopilot to a destination: set a destination (must be in a road/path) on the map, hop on your horse and begin sprinting towards the waypoint. While sprinting, hold down the SELECT button (XB1) or X button (on PS4) to enter cinematic view. Black bars will appear and you will travel to the waypoint.

**NOTE:** I've observed that sometimes, regardless of distance, when I arrive at the waypoint my horse will have a full stamina core and bar. I've seen this only when doing so with a level 4 bonded horse (and feeding it a **Horse Meal** and injecting a **Potent Horse Stimulant** before going into Cinematic Camera). Every time I've done this with a non-max-level bonded horse, it always ends up with an empty stamina core and bar regardless of what I feed/inject it with.

**NOTE:** events still occur, it's just a different camera view. You can still get attacked by a predator or enemies.

# HUNTING TIPS

### Debunking the save/reload deal.

- It works. If you're hunting rare spawns, travel to a location which is a small distance away from where the animal is known to be, sleep until the target time (if needed), save the game, and reload. Essentially, you're just refreshing all entity spawns to the area you saved the game in. This is how I managed to spot all the super rare moose spawns (like Painted Sky and along the Upper Montana). **YOU DO NOT HAVE TO EXIT AND RESTART THE WHOLE GAME FOR THE EFFECT TO WORK. THIS GOES FOR ALL SCENARIOS IN WHICH SAVING AND RELOADING IS ADVISED.**

### Use a headset if possible.

- Use a headset/headphones/earbuds when hunting. Tracking down owls by nothing but their hoots is essentially impossible with my shitty TV speakers. Hell, I even tried my old pair of Skullcandy Ink'd earbuds from 2012 and even with those I can hear everything. You don't have to use a high dollar headset... just something to isolate the game sound.

### Stealth is usually better.

- If you're roaming around looking for uncommon/rare animals, do not hunt on your horse. Go on foot, crouched, and walk slowly. Crouch running (that's what I call it) creates more noise than regular crouch walking. This difference is especially noticable when cover-scented and very close to animals. You can get within a few feet of most animals by slowly creeping up to them. Being able to get closer also opens up your options for clean kills. If stealth hunting, use the **Bow** for everything unless you're hunting down the middle ground animals which need the **Varmint Rifle** for a perfect carcass. Not to mention, while using the **Bow**, you won't scare off everything within a five mile radius. A number of other players claim the **Bow** is trash, but from my experience its quiet kills serve much better than its great but limited range (especially while hunting rare animals that spook easily, *ahem* Moose *cough cough*). The only time I recommend fast-paced hunting is when you know where the animal is or if you've an insane reaction time (primarily relating to hunting cougars/panthers).

### Cover Scent Lotion.

- It helps immensely if you're doing some stealth hunting. The crafting recipie is unlocked upon starting **Chapter 2**. You cook down the **Scent Glands** from **Skunks**, **Beavers**, and **Muskrats**. You to get way closer to animals without drawing their attention. Yes, you can stay downwind from the animal you're targeting. However, if you're out for anything and everything... you might spook a deer to your left, it runs towards a rabbit, which then runs towards what you're hunting for, spooks it, and they all leave you in the dust.

### Give the game time to spawn everything.

- Stick around the area you're hunting in for a while. As in, at least a couple days. Sleeping and/or blacking out add to this, what I'm going to call, "time spent in area" mechanic. I think it's just you giving the game time to load in all the time-sensitive and random spawns. A good example: after a whole year of playing this game I've not once seen a moose at Barrow Lagoon... until I traveled to Barrow, set the game to timelapse 72 hours (via trainer), turned around, and there was the ever-so-illusive moose at Barrow, the first and only time I've ever seen it. Same goes for all animals everywhere else. That's how I killed three grizzlies west of Wallace Station within five minutes. That's also how I killed three bull meese in Tall Trees within 10 minutes. Just sleep as long as you can or blackout a couple times. Either that, or save and reload.

### Dealing with evasive/aggressive animals effectively.

- Having trouble studying aggressive and/or skittish animals? Hit them in a non-critical area with a **Poison Arrow** (regular, white hit marker). This changes their aggro and makes them flee, allowing you to study and track them as they run.

### Farming gritty fish meat for potent predator bait.

- Fish off of the docks around **Lagras** during rainy weather. Neither **Rock Bass** nor **Perch** spawn around **Lagras**, so you've not to worry about snagging one of those bastards. On the flip side, you may get **Smallmouth/Largemouth Bass**, **Chain Pickerel**, and/or **Lake Sturgeon**. Another plus is **Bullhead Catfish**, **Channel Catfish**, and **Longnose Gar** also spawn around there, all of which yield **Gritty Fish Meat**.

### Farming wild animals.

- Most animals will decompose within 24 hours, aside from massive class animals which decompose to bones, then fully decompose. All animal carcasses from those classified as "massive" (elk, moose, bison, bears, etc) will go to bones 36 hours after being killed, then fully decompose in 72 in-game hours.
- If you're looking to farm animals for pelts, it's best to get rid of the carcass to skip the decomposition process. I've found three ways of going about this: sell the carcass as a whole (works great when doing the double skin trick), burn the carcass (with **Incendiary Buckshot**, **Fire Bottle**, or a **Fire Arrow**), or shimmy the carcass into to a body of water (even small streams work; I moved a bear into the shallow water on the southeast end of Little Creek River and it was gone after sleeping 26 hours. Alternative but slightly slower methods are: blacking out drunk and/or sleeping. To pass a huge amount of time, sleep as many times as possible and drink until you black out. If you move around a lot, I advise noting the respawn locations of and stocking up on **Aged Pirate Rum**. Only takes four to black out with the **Wolf Heart Trinket**. It's an uncommon loot item, so if you're not out for adventure, which hopefully you are, and would rather buy liquor, buy **Moonshine**. It's the highest proof liquor sold anywhere. **Kentucky Bourbon** is a close competitor but is slightly weaker than **Moonshine**.

### What is the best weapon?

In practice, the **Bow** is the best hunting weapon for three reasons:

1. Yes, its range is limited and does not yield perfect varmint pelts, but the longest range at which you can make Bow kills is outrageous. Even if you're a ways away you can close in towards the target and make the kill via deadeye still quite some distance away. Granted, though it may be slim, there is still a chance to miss even with deadeye lock-on when the target is near the outside edge of the bow's maximum range.
2. It can make clean kills on everything except most animals which require the **Varmint Rifle** (which would have been nice to have some Varmint Arrows or just make either Regular or Small Game arrows cleanly kill the varmints). Most varmint kills with regular arrows will almost always yield a one-less-star pelt, i.e. you kill a three star and it will almost always drop to two stars. Be that as it may, there are exceptions to this: a headshot with a poison arrow to beavers and iguanas almost always yields a perfect pelt for me when skinning the two-star carcass. But every other varmint (skunks, possums, etc) rarely gives a perfect pelt with any arrow kill.
3. You get to craft and use **Poison/Fire/Dynamite Arrows**.

- Scoped rifles are more powerful than medium rifles and have near-hitscan bullet velocity, but two caveats: they must be scoped in when aiming (unless the de-scope glitch is used) and do not allow dead eye lock-on (even if de-scoped via glitch). The **Carcano** surpasses the **Rolling Block** on every point. It does everything the **Rolling Block** does, but with a six-round clip. Both of them will one-shot-headshot-kill a bear at any reasonable distance. Overall in practice, an unscoped **Carcano** is the best heavy rifle. It must be noted as well that a **Carcano** with **Express Ammo** deals more damage per shot than a **Rolling Block** with **Express Ammo**.
- The medium rifles, the **Bolt Action** sacrifices just a bit of damage for better accuracy, fire rate, and reload. All in all, unless you're constantly taking very long shots, the **Bolt Action** is better in practice and works for most everyone. The **Springfield's** slightly higher damage is not a proportional tradeoff to the loss of accuracy and single-round capacity.
- For revolvers, the **LeMat** comes out on top in terms of damage. The  **Double Action** has the best DPS (damage per second), but the **LeMat** also offers a secondary shotgun barrel. Slow to reload both the cap and ball ammo as well as the center grapeshot barrel, but you get everything in one package. The shotgun barrel itself appears to have quite less effective range than a **Sawed Off Shotgun**, but it's still mad effective at close range as a shotgun is meant to be.
- For pistols, **Mauser** is the best all-around. Yes, the **M1899** has better damage and accuracy. Yes, the **Semi Auto** slightly higher fire rate allows it to make stupid fast deadeye kills. The **Mauser** reigns because it gets the extra two rounds per clip (10 total; where as the **Semi Auto** and **M1899**) and nearly matches the **Semi Auto Pistol** rate of fire. It's essentially the middle ground, best of both worlds.

Below is a damage chart organized by weapon and bullet type (ordered corresponding to what's in-game). Weapon rows are grouped by class, with the highest damage of its class being at the top and all others in descending order. Incendiary and explosive ammo was not tested because... well, you know. Shotguns weren't tested either because... you get the gist. Testing was done with five shots of each bullet type for all weapons to eliminate one-off cases. All shots were to a grizzly's rear upper thigh (outside any critical/fatal areas). Damage was measured via RampageTrainer's in-game NPC debug feature.

Split point rounds deal slightly more damage at close range than high velocity rounds. I've yet to test them at longer ranges, though I imagine it'll be no different from a distance. Weapon familiarity does not affect damage. I've not tested shotguns yet. All unique weapons are identical to their regular counterparts (in terms of damage) except for those listed below.

**[*]** Poison Arrows deal the same initial damage as Regular Arrows, but continue to deal damage at a certain rate. I couldn't find any immediate information on what that rate is, but have observed it myself with RampageTrainer's debug menu.

### How to get perfect skins, pelts, hides, etc.

According to my own testing, all "varmints" can be skinned for a perfect pelt when headshot with a regular arrow except for the **Skunk** and **Gila Monster**. You're still chancing it, though.

Below is a chart showing the ideal weapon for all animals when shooting for perfect pelts. [Source.](https://redd.it/a3afo9)

# FISHING TIPS

- Contrary to what the game describes, you can catch just about every fish on any bait/lure.
- Also contrary to compendium entries, weather doesn't seem to make a damn difference.
- Certain fish are attracted to certain lures/baits, but quick-pressing RT will attract all fish to your lure/bait. Be that as mit may, some may not necessarily nibble/bite it. Flicking RT more than once while fish are near the bait/lure will scare them off.
- Small fish will not nibble/bite regular/special lures (aside from the **Special Spinner**).
- The **Special Spinner** attracts all species of fish and all species will bite it. Everything from bluegill to northern pike. Once acquired, it is a permanent inventory item and cannot be lost due to cutting or snapping the line.
- **Lures** (both regular and special variants) work great if you're shooting for only big/medium fish as small fish will not bite any of them.
- **Special Lures** are permanent inventory items and cannot be lost to a line snap.
- **Special Lures** count as their regular counterparts in the **Compendium** Fish entries. As in, you can catch a **Channel Catfish** with either a **Regular** or **Special Swamp Lure** as both count towards 100% for that species. Regular baits (bread, corn, worms, etc) are not cross-compatible for **Compendium** completion.
- If you dislike clutter and don't plan on using other types of baits/lures (worms, crayfish, crickets, regular lures), do not buy a whole lot of them as you have to manually lose them. There is no "discard" option in the satchel for these.
- Push LS down to lower your rod. Keep it down while reeling when awaiting a bite. When you get a bite, pull LS back. This both sets the hook and pulls the fish in at the same time, giving you a head start right off the bat.
- Continue using LS up and down to pull the fish in faster, unless you're a glutton for punishment. Reeling in fish like the **Legendary Muskie** are a bitch if you don't know about using LS to make faster progress. I learned the hard way, you needn't.
- All fish have a specific pattern of nibbling/biting. Once you can recall what fish do what, you won't even need to use Eagle Eye to see what's down there.
- When using any bait, after a number of nibbles and bites your bait will completely deteriorate and you'll have to reel in and rebait. Lures are not affected by numerous bites.

# ITEM SELL PRICES

### Animal Skins

*All prices are based on Saint Denis Trapper. Animals listed below each Trapper location are local to the area and will sell for the normal price. Selling animals not local to the area you sell them in gives a small bonus in sell price. The general rule of thumb is the farther away from the animal's habitat, the more it will sell for. Go figure. Cross-country hauling one moose pelt to the Tumbleweed Butcher just for an extra $2.00-3.00*

Local Area | Animal(s)
:--- | ---
Saint Denis | Alligator<br>American Bullfrog<br>Black Bear<br>Boar<br>Chipmunk<br>Cormorant<br>Crane<br>Egret<br>Heron<br>Oriole<br>Panther<br>Pelican<br>Seagull<br>Western Toad<br>

### Orchids

- **Orchids** are flowering plants which can be found sporadically around the entire map aside from **Great Plains, WE** and all of **New Austin** (aside from a single **Sparrow's Egg Orchid** in **Rio Bravo, NA**).
- After completing `Dutchesses and Other Animals`, you can collect the `Rare Orchids Order` from the board at any **Post Office**. This allows **Orchids** and **Heron/Egret/Spoonbill Plumes** to be mailed to **Algernon Wasp** for cash. **Gator Eggs** can be sold to the **Trapper**.

**WARNING:** AFTER COMPLETING ALL STAGES OF `Dutchesses and Other Animals`, DO NOT SEND MORE THAN ONE ORCHID SPECIES AT A TIME. [More info here.](#unable-to-send-orchids-by-mail)

# BUGS

*These are bugs which don't appear to have exploitable benefits.*

### Unable to send orchids by mail.

After taking the **Rare Orchids Order**, sending more than one species of orchid at a time will glitch out the mailing order and you will no longer be able to send orchids nor receive the money for orchids you've sent. Always send only one orchid and receive its payment **one at a time** to avoid glitching it. The mailing menu automatically sends all of whatever Orchid you select for mailing, and this case doesn't apply to the glitch. However, sending more than one Orchid species (example **Dragon's Mouth** and **Acuna's Star**) at the same time will glitch out the mailing order and you will no longer be able to send Orchids or receive payments for them.

### Double skins.

- If an animal can be picked up, you can get two ticks added to its `Skinned` counter in the **Compendium**. This does not yield two skins per animal, it just counts as skinning it twice.

### Severe flickering or outright blackout in Bluewater Marsh and/or Bayou Nwa.

I've found this to occur only when I'm near a **Snowy Egret** or the **Bluewater Marsh Ghost**. No clue why as it has never happened anywhere else.

### Javier not getting off his horse during Chez Porter Homestead Robbery.

I've run across one glitch twice: once on Xbox One and once on PC. Basically, you start the robbery, travel to **Chez Porter** with Javier, but when the black bars retract and Javier advises to go on foot from there, he won't get off his horse. The quickest way to fix this is suicide, but you can also run off to abandon Javier thus failing the mission. Either way, afterwards he should spawn off his horse and you can continue the mission.

### Locations not being noted on the map.

I know of several locations which have buggy overworld map names:

- Dormin Crest, Grizzlies West, AM
- Planter's Baun, Grizzlies West, AM
- Nekoti Rock, Tall Trees, WE
- Rattlesnake Hollow, Cholla Springs, NA

These can be obtained, they're just dodgy as shit. Save your game quite a ways away from each before entering them for the first time. Just keep rolling the dice until the name shows up, move onto the next, save again, enter the next, etc, etc. The only location I've never been able to obtain is Granger's Hoggery. I've no idea why.

For **Dormin Crest**, you must enter the cabin while the random encounter is still active. (Where there's a trail coming out of the front door.) I noticed in `PC v1436` the front door jots aside just a tiny bit just before reaching to open it. This only happens when the event is active. Still, I had to keep reloading and retrying to get it to show up on the map.

For **Planter's Baun**, I did not explore Grizzlies West extensively as long as I could. Barrow Lagoon and the surrounding area remained with fog of war. In Chapter 3, even though I hadn't explored up there and the fog of war was still there, the name showed up on the map shortly after starting Chapter 3. Yes, on top of the fog of war. I've no idea why or how.

For **Nekoti Rock** and **Rattlesnake Hollow**, there appear to be very small, specific areas you have to visit to get the names to pop. I've not narrowed down exactly where aside from inside the small caves and atop the highest peaks just aside OOB (respectively).

### Discount at Saint Denis shops as reward for killing Jean Marc as ordered by Mayor Henri Lemieux.

This can be done with Arthur and the discount will transfer to John. However, I calculated my discount with max honor and post-story mode I'm getting only a 55% discount. According to my player menu I am getting the full 50% max honor discount. According to everyone online the discount is meant to be 10% regardless of honor. I'm unsure if I just have a glitch, if the total discount at shops is meant to have be capped at 55%, or if the discount is lowered to 5% if transferred to John rather than doing the Mayor's final mission as John and (possibly) getting the full 10%. Regardless, 5% is better than nothing.

### Unable to save custom outfits.

Apparently this has been around for a long time and to this day goes unfixed. What happens is your saved custom outfits start glitching by starting at two, then to three, and eventually if the glitch continues you'll no longer be able to save any custom outfits. This can be bypassed by using a trainer on PC, but the only "easy" way around it is to unlock the **Legend of the East** outfit, equip and store it on your horse, then load outfits from your trainer. As far as consoles go, if there is a known workaround I haven't been made aware of it.

### Legend of the East outfit not unlocking after 90th challenge.

This is a glitch that remains unfixed. Many players have completed Bandit 10 as their final challenge and not had the outfit unlock. I, myself, have had it not unlock doing Explorer 10 as my final challenge. Always make a save before completing your final (90th) challenge, and if nothing else avoid doing Bandit 10 or Explorer 10 as your final challenge as these are problem-causers. If there is no turning back (like the position I was in, saving after completing the last challenge):

1. Open the settings menu and press [Y] (on Xbox controller) to open the cheat menu.
2. Enter the cheat "Vanity. All is vanity"
3. Close the settings menu.
4. Open a Trainer; I use Rampage.
5. Enable the cheat bypass function.
6. Go back to the Settings menu, enable the cheat you entered (unlock all outfits)
7. Go back in game and equip the **Legend of the East** outfit at camp.
8. Save your game.

### Micro-Stuttering, FPS Drops, ERR_GFX_STATE Popup/Crash, and other graphics issues.

For micro-stuttering (I had it about once every ten seconds):

- Restart your computer. Yes, I know, stereotypical. But it generally works even for me.
- Change your graphics API. If you're using Vulkan, change to DX12. If the contrary, do the opposite. See which works better. Some users Note Vulkan runs a bit faster but DX12 looks crisper/sharper.
- Update/reinstall your graphics driver. Yeah, again, cliche... but the shit worked for me. Be sure to do a **CLEAN INSTALL** when reinstalling/updating the driver. It fixed the micro-stuttering I was encountering (about once every ten seconds). System info: ASUS G14 (2021) AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS @ 3301 MHz, 16384MB, NVIDIA RTX 3060 Laptop GPU, RDR2 Build 1436, NVIDIA Driver v471.96
- Periodically delete everything in the Settings folder except for "system.xml" (to retain graphics settings). Some sources claim that deleting the `.bin` files isn't necessary, but I do it anyway and it works. Doing this can also fix crashing because of `ERR_GFX_STATE`. [[Reference.]](https://www.reddit.com/r/RDR2/comments/dxlreb/err_gfx_state/)

The last step can be semi-automated using [BleachBit](https://github.com/bleachbit/bleachbit). (I began using it when Avast decided to fuck up CCleaner.) All you have to do is `BleachBit > Preferences > Custom > Add Folder` and add your RDR2 `Settings` folder. Then, `BleachBit > Preferences > Whitelist` and add your `system.xml` file to prevent BleachBit from deleting it (retaining your GFX settings).

# GLITCHES

*These are bugs/glitches which can be exploited.*

### Looting saddle bags and not getting the shit kicked out of you.

*This glitch allows you to search both saddle bags of any horse without getting kicked in the face.*

1. Hop on the horse you want to loot.
2. Ride/lead the horse right next to any solid, static object that will partially block you phsically digging through the saddle bag, be it a tree, rock/boulder, wagon, train, etc. Ensure after you hop off that the **Search Saddle Bag** prompt is still there. A good point of reference (for me) is the edge of the object must be just behind the saddle bag.
3. Search the saddle bag. When done right, the game will not allow the animation to complete because you'd clip too far into the horse. This works in much the same way as evading the full animal skinning animation.
4. Enjoy your saddle bag loot never having to get kicked in the face ever again.

### Break down large fish.

For whatever reason, there is no prompt to break down large fish. Here's how: after picking it up right after landing it, select the "cook" option. **DO NOT EAT THE FIRST PIECE.** Instead, store it in your satchel, then exit the cooking menu. All large fish yield 2-4 (random quantity) of their associated meat.

### Keep temporary documents.

[Video of using the glitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZXI3JYEqv8) by [Alcomahol](https://gtaforums.com/profile/1162284-alcomahol/).

You can obtain almost every temporary document using this glitch. "Almost" because some documents cannot be stored permanently even with this glitch.

1. Inspect/open the document.
2. Pause the game, enter photo mode, and quickly exit. This enables all document controls for a very, very brief period of time. Including the ability to store it. On PC, you can spam F6 and Enter.

List of documents obtainable and retainable via this glitch:

- Diary (during `The Inquities of History`)

### Launch from horse with carcass stowed on side.

This might not be very useful, but I found that with a Condor stored on the side of a horse, getting off on the same side launches me up about 10 feet before landing. I've been able to launch atop buildings you normally wouldn't be able to access doing this.

### Getting caught when quickly dismounting your horse.

While wearing the **Legendary Coyote Half Chaps**, I found that occasionally I'll fumble off my horse when dismounting while the horse is still running. This hasn't happened with anything else, so far.

### Steal any horse from any stable.

[Source.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2J00n9a7-s)

*This works with all horses at every Stable. You must be able to buy the horse after it's unlocked. (Unlocking it puts the horse physically in the stable to be bought. For example, you can't steal an Amber Champagne MFT from Scarlett Meadows before Chapter 4.) Stealing horses in this manner doesn't reduce honor. Some Stables are easier to hit than others, though.*

1. Get any wagon or buggy. Larger ones are preferable.
2. Ride the wagon to the Stable which houses the horse you want to steal.
3. Put on a mask/bandana.
4. As you enter the Stable, pull out any gun, aim, and fire just as the horse enters the doors of the stable. Doing this prevents the Stable doors from closing.
5. Ensure you've at least one witness. It's necessary for this method.
6. Park the wagon between the Stable doors. (Again, to ensure they don't close.)
7. Hop off the wagon and go to the horse you want to steal.
8. You won't be able to mount the horse, so feed it using the **Horse Menu** until it registers as a **Temporary Horse**.
9. Hide until the witnesses/law stop searching. You can mount the horse just before the search ends to auto-enter the stable. If not, the black bars will appear and you'll enter horseless into the Stable.
10. Exit the stable, travel a ways away, and whistle for your temporary horse. Most of the time they will jump over the gates and run to you. If it doesn't come after a while, move around while continuing to call the horse.
11. Mount the horse and take it to any Stable, even the one you stole it from. Doesn't matter where.
12. Saddle up and enjoy your free horse!

### Remove scope from carcano and/or rolling block rifles.

[Source.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mst4pshFcD0)

Want a scopeless sniper in place of a Bolt Action or Springfield? In story mode, you can permanently de-scope (un-scope?) both the Rolling Block and Carcano Rifles. This glitch isn't entirely permanent, but only because you can just go to a Gunsmith and re-equip any scope to negate it. The rifle(s) will remain scopeless as long as you don't re-scope them at the Gunsmith. They will not gain the auto-aim function even if it's turned on. They still operate as the regular rifle, you're just no longer forced to scope in.

1. Hop on your horse, equip either sniper, and place it in the saddle holster.
2. Enter any Gunsmith.
3. Change the scope on the rifle. (Doesn't matter which, it just has to be changed.)
4. While still viewing in the Gunsmith menu, equip the rifle to your shoulder.
5. Exit the Gunsmith and draw the rifle you holstered earlier (LB on XB1, unsure on PS4).
6. The scopeless rifle on your back will drop. Pick it up.

### Universal saddle blankets.

[Source.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSIyry-KePE)

*Some Trapper saddles have unique blankets. This method does not work with two saddles which have thier own unique blankets. You can glitch the panther blanket with the Rattlesnake Vaquero Saddle but not with the Alligator Saddle.*

1. Enter a stable.
2. Equip the saddle which has the blanket you want to use.
3. Exit the stable.
4. Re-enter the stable.
5. Equip the saddle you want to use with the blanket.
6. Exit the stable.
7. Enjoy your Rattlesnake Saddle with a Panther blanket! (Or whichever combination you choose.)

### Getting the Silver Dapple Pinto Missouri Fox Trotter at no cost for Arthur.

[Source.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bATG5JB9cNA)

[Alternative method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehB9-N1VMa4) using render distance exploit.

1. *Save your game.*
2. Trigger the mission **Arcadia for Amateurs - III**. This does not work when replaying the mission.
3. When nearing the horses, enter **Eagle Eye** and track the Fox Trotter. Ensure you are tracking the correct horse. Sometimes its trail with be golden (like a Legendary Animal) and show up as *Unknown Animal*, but most of the time it'll show as **Herd** like the other horses.
4. Keep spamming Eagle Eye to maintain its trail. Just before you pass by Albert Mason, enter Eagle Eye one last time. This will extend the time you have to skip the cutscene before Eagle Eye cuts out.
5. Skip the cutscene immediately to end the mission as soon as possible. Eagle Eye deteriorates during the cutscene.
6. Continue Eagle Eye-ing the trail and follow it until you reach the horse. If the trail clips through the ground or becomes increasingly erratic, continue in the same direction you last saw the trail heading in. On all of my run throughs using this glitch, the Silver Dapple runs to **Elysian Pool**.
7. When you locate the horse, run alongside it and spam **Jump to Horse**. It will take some time because the horse is so jittery and you must be in perfect alignment to jump.
8. Tame the horse and bond it to **Level 1** via feeding.
9. DO NOT GET OFF OF THE HORSE. Ride it to the nearest **Stable**.
10. Stable the horse and saddle up your original horse.
11. Exit the stable, save the game, and reload.
12. Enjoy your free, wild **Silver Dapple Pinto Missouri Fox Trotter**! :)

*There are alternative methods of doing this, but they generally involve a ton of waiting, reloading, and praying to RNGsus. Yes, I'm talking about the random encounter with they lady whose horse "up and died on her". No, I don't recommend you try that over this unless you enjoy pain.*

### Saving Arthur's money for John.

[Source.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu5s3l6w7h0)

The **Aberdeen Pig Farm** is inhabited by an incestual brother and sister, whom together work as a team of serial killers. There is a sort of side mission with these two: as either John or Arthur you can eat dinner with them. During which they'll offer some drinks. After drinking a few times, you pass out and wake up in their body dump site with no money. A decent backing for sticking to the story, I think, is: Arthur gets robbed, John reads about it in his journal, John goes to the farm and takes the money as it's of no use to Arthur at that point. :)

Go there and get robbed as Arthur right before the mission **"Red Dead Redemption"** (the last mission in which the player controls Arthur) but do not go back and kill them, nor get your money. Wait until you take control of John, travel to the farm, and retreive the cash from the safe behind the picture of "Mama" directly behind the front door. Kill or spare them as you see fit.

### Getting out of bounds.

You'll need enough alcohol to blackout to do this, and it works anywhere applicable. Most spots under cliffs work well. If you've got the **Wolf Heart Trinket**, you'll need a lot. Now, to get compendium entries and sketches as Arthur for animals specific to New Austin (and/or Guarma before/after of Chapter 5), or just to run around and explore, you can travel out of bounds via the far west end (at the edge of a drop-off) in the **Devil's Cave**. If you're running post-Epilogue and want to explore the southern side out-of-map or travel to Guarma much quicker, an infinitely faster method is to travel to a specific point on the southern shore of the **San Luis River**.) Do the following once at either location:

1. Drink until you black out.
2. Do nondescript things while blacked out. (How the character scales seemingly sheer surfaces whilst blackout drunk is unclear. Ah, the wonders of moonshine!)
3. Wake up out of map.

**GETTING TO GUARMA:** Guarma is located at the southeast (bottom right) corner of the map. Go in that general direction until you hit the low poly (jellytown) ground. Any low-poly area is considered the physical "end of the map" which you'll fall through. If you hit a 90-degree corner, turn on it (after turning you should be facing south). Follow the seam until you begin to float (walk up an invisible hill). Turn to face the low poly section, walk a few steps over the seam and Guarma's map will render in.

- A quick side note: I black out drunk on the east side of **Aurora Basin** and woke up on the west side out-of-bounds. I will try to replicate this soon, but the few times afterwards resulted in no joy.

### Speed crafting.

*This involves using third-party programs. Some recipies can be done seamlessly by holding A (on Xbox). For example, ammunition.*

Download [CheatEngine](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php). I use the RAR archive version which you don't have to join Patreon for; it doesn't come bundled with "optional" adware/bloatware like the installer does, but feel free to use what you want. Be sure to launch the 64-bit version of CheatEngine when using it in RDR2. Open "RDR2.exe" via the Open Process dialog and check "Enable Speedhack". You can adjust the speed as you see fit. When finished, uncheck the box to disable the speedhack.

Sometimes, a glitch may occur where the crafting process of some items (seemingly random) will freeze halfway through. I use 500x speed and travel near Colter when doing this, which seems to lower the chance of this happening.

I have not found a concrete way to alter item counts with CheatEngine. Looking into editing save files.

### Duplicate journal sketches.

Some POIs can be sketched as both Arthur and John (meaning two journal sketches per game):

- Cave Devil
- Tree King
- Hermit Man
- Blind Man Cassidy
- Strange Statues

### KKK

Encountered some guys after Epilogue II northeast of Lucky's Cabin (Heartlands, NH). Unsure if they continuously spawn post story or if they're one-time events, but I've found them in four places, three of which were in Lemoyne.

### Skinner Brothers Yelps

The sounds made by **Skinner Brothers** during ambushes and attacks are the same made by **Wapiti Tribe** members during **My Last Boy**. Likely just a borrowed scare tactic, but the **Skinner Brothers** might have some other motive in doing this. Perhaps some members are tied to the tribe and are protecting land in **Tall Trees**. Or maybe it's just the former. In either case, the jumpscare potential is unreal. Trotting along the paths, you hear screaming out of nowhere but you know what's coming.

### Voices at Colter

Spooked by those voices before? Especially up at Colter where you know damn well there's no one else around? Perhaps I'm the outlier, but these scared the fuck out of me the first time I was back up there post-story. When returning to previous Van der Linde camps, muffled voices can be heard speaking lines mentioned prior on the story. This happens at every previous camp, not just Colter. But hearing flashback voices up there, at midnight, no wind, no wolf howls, owl hoots, or fox yelps, in the snow was a spooky first experience.
