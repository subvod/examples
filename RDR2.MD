# SURVIVING IN THE WILDERNESS

You're better off with a horse, but it's certainly possible to survive on your own. Survival is pretty straightforward: kill things, collect things, and eat said things. Some consumables provide greater benefit than others and/or are only available in certain regions.

### The Basics

*NOTE: nothing grows up in the Northwestern snow-covered areas of Ambarino.*

- Cooked meats refill all cores by a certain amount. If you prefer store-bought items to replenish your cores, I stick with **Baked Beans** and **Fine Brandy**. Different cuts of meat can be harvested from the wild. Different animals yield different types of meat. Aside from **Big Game** (see below in "Advanced Survival"), the most nutritious cuts are: **Venison**, **Pork**, **Game**, **Succulent Fish**, **Prime Beef**, and **Exotic Bird**. The most common animals for these cuts are **Deer**, **Pronghorn**, **Elk**, **Duck**, and **Rabbit**. Though, **Moose**, **Wild Boar**, **Collard Peccary**, **Domestic Pigs**, **Bison**, **Ox**, **Bull**, **Cow**, **Pheasant**, **Pelican**, **Macaw (Parrot)**, **Carolina Parakeet**, **Sockeye Salmon**, and **Rainbow Trout** all yield meats that greatly restore all cores. When seasoned, these meats fully restore the core associated with the herb used.
- **Wild Carrots** are the holy grail of horse upkeep. They grow everywhere. Yes, there are two different carrots. You cannot use bought/looted regular **Carrots** in crafting recipes, but they provide the same benefits as **Wild Carrots**. Feeding your horse is straightforward. If you're not big on harvesting **Wild Carrots** yourself, farmed **Carrots** are available for purchase at Stables. However if you buy provisions from a Stable, **Hay** is the far superior choice as it is the cheapest cost-per-benefit.
- Weapon loadout doesn't really matter unless you have a preference towards a certain gun or are going for clean kills. I run with: akimbo **LeMat Revolvers**, shouldered **Bow**, and crossback **Varmint Rifle**. LeMats are single-action cap-and-ball revolvers and have super slow reload (which dead eye counteracts), but also have a secondary shotgun barrel allowing high damage (and dismemberment) up close in a revolver package. The **Bow** covers essentially everything for hunting aside from its middle ground: "moderate" sized animals. The **Varmint Rifle** covers this middle ground: Iguanas, Gila Monsters, Opossums, Beavers, Badgers, Skunks, Raccoons, and all large birds (Owls, Hawks, Eagles, Cranes, Egrets, Condors, Vultures/Buzzards, Herons, etc). Even with the **Buck Antler Trinket**, if you land a headshot with a regular arrow on any of these (and would like to sell the carcass whole), the carcass will always be a 2-star. However, if you skin/pluck the same animal (example: Owl headshot with regular arrow) you'll get the items to use/sell as if it were a 3-star. If I'd no plans to preserve/sell whole carcasses and skin/pluck everything I came across, I can run just the Bow as my single primary. However, it's at the player's discretion. It's an open world for a reason.

### "Advanced" Survival

- **Gathering Materials** for crafting is a big part of RDR2. Luckily, if you don't care about honor, there's a shortcut to getting mass quantities of a few select herbs. Rather than go around gathering each one at a time, kill and loot **Murphy Brood** in northwestern **Heartlands**, **Strangers** (residents) at **Butcher Creek**, and **Skinner Brothers** in **Tall Trees**. They all have a chance of holding 2 to 4 units of **Currant**, **Sage**, **Ginseng**, **Violet Snowdrop**, or **Burdock Root**. They also have a chance of giving other items: **Regular/Potent Snake Oil** (only from **Murphy Brood**), regular **Herbivore/Predator Bait**, **Opened/Unopened Cover Scent**, and **Moonshine** (only from **Butcher Creek Residents**).
- **Gold Cores** for the player come in handy, and maintaining cores is a key part in RDR2. Player cores can be gilded (made golden) with **Big Game Meat** (harvested from **Alligators**, **Wolves**, **Grizzly Bears**, **Black Bears**, **Cougars**, and **Panthers**) seasoned with the corresponding herb (**Wild Mint** found around rivers/creeks/lakes for *Health*, **Oregano** found near forested areas for *Stamina*, and **Thyme** found in open areas for *Dead Eye*). **Seasoned Big Game Meat** fully restores all cores and yields a gold core for the associated herb used for seasoning lasting 24 in-game hours.
- **Gold Cores** for the player's horse are immensely beneficial, whether often in firefights or trotting around large distances. **Horse Meal** yields both gold health and stamina cores for a day. The recipie pamphlet can be obtained in **Chapter 3** as a reward for Kieran's item request of Burdock Root. It requires three of each **Currant**, **Beets**, and **Hay** to craft. **Currant** has two variants: **Golden Currant** (all over the northern half of **New Hanover**; also **Tall Trees** and **Great Plains**) and **Blackcurrant** (west of Armadillo). **Beets** and **Hay** can be looted from random NPC campsites/wagons or bought from **Stables**. However the percentage of random campsites/wagons which spawn with these materials is quite infrequent, and even then you'll be taking a gamble. You may get only one of either Beets or Hay at each if you even get either of them. These same campsites/wagons may spawn Celery, Peach, Apple, Pear, etc. Be that as it may, one Horse Meal crafted from Beets and Hay bought from Stables costs $2.70 (versus the $5.00 **"Horse Care Package"** from Stables). Reasonably cheaper than the latter even with high honor discounts. In the long run, it's well worth the time spent traveling to a Stable to stock up on both for making Horse Meal on-the-go. However **Wild Carrots** work just fine, you just have to feed your horse slightly more often.
- **Special Horse Reviver** and **Horse Ointment** are the only alternative and only true "wilderness" methods of getting gold cores for your horse. The former requires (two of each) **Ginseng**, **Wild Carrot**, and **Parasol Mushroom**. The latter requires (one of each) **Sage**, **Common Bulrush**, and **Yarrow**. They are not bad tradeoffs for Horse Meal as they require less (but more various) ingredients per batch. If you're keen on the "true wilderness" part of the game, go for these two. If you've got the time and money to head into town and stock up on **Beets** and **Hay** ($89.10 and one minute to get 99 of both from a Stable), **Horse Meal** holds the edge benefit/investment wise. *NOTE: HORSE OINTMENT DOES NOT CLEAN YOUR HORSE. YOU'LL STILL HAVE TO BRUSH IT IF IT GETS DIRTY.*
- **Poison Arrows** are key when needing to study and/or fend off aggressive animals. Crafting one requires one **Arrow**, one **Flight Feather**, and one **Oleander Sage** (found in the swamps and along the bank of the **Kamassa River** in **Lemoyne**). Hitting anything with a Poison Arrow will cause it to flee, allowing you to study animals as they run away. Even better: spent **Poison Arrows** retain the poison and can be recollected and reused, unlike **Poison Throwing Knives**.
- **Split Point Rounds** decrease dead eye drain, yield the same damage as "high velocity" rounds, and have increased accuracy. Taking the time to fill up your split point rounds makes a difference that you'll notice. Also, in pure speculation with no numbers to back it up: I feel like split point rounds yield more critical hits overall versus regular/high velocity/express rounds.
- **Potent Predator/Herbivore Bait** can help quite a bit if you're a stealth hunter. Potent Predator Bait requires a berry (found everywhere) and gritty fish meat, which can be obtained from **Bluegill** (found everywhere, but a notably high population at **Calumet Ravine**), **Bullhead Catfish** (bend of the Kamassa River west of Lagras, in addition to Lagras itself), and/or **Longnose Gar** (found exclusively in **Lagras**). **Potent Herbivore Bait** requires one **Vanilla Flower** (all around the swamps of Bayou Nwa), one **Violet Snowdrop** (high mountain and snowy regions, primarily in **Ambarino**), and one of any **Mushroom** (found across the map). You can craft regular Predator Bait from **Stringy Meat** and a **Berry**, but why not make the most of what you harvest and stick with potent?
- **Cover Scent Lotion** helps a ton in stealth hunting. You can get way closer to animals without drawing their attention. Craft it from the beginning of **Chapter 2** using **Scent Glands** from **Skunks**, **Beavers**, and **Muskrats**.
- **Flight Feathers** are required for every "improved" arrow. See below (**Animal Fat**) for more details.
- **Animal Fat** isn't a necessity, but is required for **Explosive Rounds** (unlocked at beginning of **Chapter 2**) which are both fun to use and extremely useful when taking down legendary animals. **Canada Geese**, **Ducks** (not Loons), and **Beavers** are by far the best animals for this as they are plentiful in many areas across the map (north of New Austin), but **Boars/Pigs** and **Bears** also yield animal fat. **Geese** and **Ducks** yield **Flight Feathers** (for all improved **Arrow** types) and **Animal Fat** while **Beavers** yield **Scent Glands** (for **Cover Scent Lotion**) and **Animal Fat**. *NOTE: A PRIME LOCATION FOR GEESE, DUCKS, AND BEAVERS IS OWANJILA.*
- **Campsites and Cabins/Shacks** inhabited/created by NPCs can house a ton of useful items. Most also have a bed or sleeping bag. If you're not concerned about your honor, there are no rules.

### Honor And Benefits
Surviving on your own is quite easy, cooking food and crafting tonics/ammo. If you don't care for the outfits only available with high honor, honor level in general makes no difference. However high honor does have benefits:
- Shops give up to a 50% discount (with max high honor) on all items, as well as the ability to buy "high honor" outfits. Low honor does not affect shop prices.
- With negative honor, you loot more "shortcut" items (**Cocaine Gum** and **Chewing Tobacco**) from bodies.
- With maximum negative honor, the ambient sounds of deadeye change.
- Most story dialog changes based on honor level.
- Arthur and John's mannerisms change based on honor. Example: saying "don't make me do this" with high honor versus "I will kill you right here" with low honor.
- In Chapter 6, actions that affect honor have a multiplier of 1.5x. Use this to your advantage if you run low honor as Arthur but want the "high honor" ending.

# GENERAL TIPS AND TRICKS

### Testing Tonics
Below is data gathered from testing **Potent Tonics** against their **Special** variants. Testing was done by sprinting or entering dead eye right after consuming the associated items. Time was clocked when the bar was fully used up and the gold core fully depleted.

#### Stamina
1. Oregano Big Game + Special Bitters
- 01:54:04
2. Oregano Big Game + Potent Bitters
- 01:42:87

#### Dead Eye
1. Thyme Big Game + Special Snake Oil
- 0:44:21
2. Thyme Big Game + Potent Snake Oil
- 0:41:68

As you can see, **Special Bitters** makes a bit of a difference, where as **Special Snake Oil** does fairly little in terms of better fortification. Health testing is tricky...

### Fast Weapon Familiarity
- Raid enemy camps and use dead eye to get headshots.

### Fast Level 4 Bonding Horses
- Leading your horse yields more bonding points per minute than anything else. The old rubber band trick works for this:
1. Begin leading your horse.
2. Travel to the open fields of **The Heartlands**. Alternatively you can go to the plains west of Blackwater, but there are more snakes out that way. (Getting close to any aggressive animal will end the lead.)
3. Wrap a rubber band around your thumbstick and the end of either palm grip (depending on the length of the rubber band).
4. Do other things for a while. (About 20 minutes.)
5. Come back to your fully bonded horse.

- *THIS IDLE METHOD DOESN'T ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF HOSTILITY FROM BOUNTY HUNTERS, BUSHWHACKERS, ROBBERS, AGGRESSIVE ANIMALS, ETC. MIGHT WANT TO PEEK AT THE SCREEN EVERY NOW AND THEN AND/OR KEEP AN EAR OUT.*
- *If on the PC version without a controller, you can use [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to simulate holding down the movement key(s).*

### Map Icons
- Here's the map I use for reference: https://gtaforums.com/topic/968364-complete-map-with-all-discoverable-icons/
- Animal drawings are added when an animal is sighted in a specific area. It must be both studied and tracked at least once to add icons the the overworld map. The best thing to do is study and track everything you come across. Hell, I even kill everything I see because why not? Additional locations will be marked as animals are "sighted" (moving the crosshair to highlight them). Looking at animals through binoculars (after studying and tracking at least one to fill the compendium) is by far the most efficient way to populate the map with animal icons. Though, I personally just run around killing everything with **Poison Arrows**. :)
- Plant drawings are added when a plant is studied and picked/eaten at least once, then picked,/eaten in the same specific areas. Best to pick everything you come across.
- Point of interest, dreamcatcher, dinosaur bone, and rock carving locations are added when they are "investigated".

### Triggering Pearson's Rabbit Request to Obtain the Unique Scout Jacket
- It's available from Ch.2 to Ch.6.
- Pearson will be drinking beer at his wagon's table. When you walk near him, it will only give a **Greet** prompt when the request is available for activation (like every other request).
- I ran around camp in Ch.2 for 15 minutes real time and never got the request (had full cores the whole time). I went to camp in Ch.3 after consuming Moonshine, Cocaine Gum, and Chewing Tobacco to completely deplete my cores and voila, requested right as I walk into camp! Maybe coincidental, I've no numbers for solid proof this works. But if it is just coincidence, it's one hell of a coincidence. Also tested in Ch. 2. Took about 20 minutes, but those 20 minutes are nothing compared to a few hours total spend entering/exiting camp to get him to spawn there. It's worth a shot. :)

### Alcohol

*Below is a list of alcohol values per item. Value amounts to "proof*. Higher proof means drunk quicker.

Name | Value
:--- | ---
Saloon Beer | 0.1
Saloon Whiskey | 0.1
Opened Guarma Rum | 0.1
Opened Fine Brandy | 0.1
Opened Gin | 0.1
Opened Kentucky Bourbon | 0.13
Guarma Rum | 0.17
Fine Brandy | 0.17
Gin | 0.17
Kentucky Bourbon | 0.25
Moonshine | 0.3
Whiskey Bottle | 0.4
Aged Pirate Rum | 0.5

### Saddles

There is no definitive "best all around saddle", it all depends upon personal preference. I go for the **Panther Trail Saddle** because it looks the best on my Amber Champagne MFT. (The looks are the worth the 4% compromise to me.) However, the **Beaver Roping Saddle** is technically the "best" saddle in terms of game logic because it provides the highest Stamina Regen (same as **Panther** and **Rattlesnake** saddles) and **Health Core Drain** bonuses. My reasoning behind this is: horse health core drain intensifies when they're dirty. I don't brush my horse often, so a lot of times it's just dirty. That being the case, the occasional health core penalty is lowered that much more with the Beaver Saddle.

- **HCD** *Health Core Drain*
- **SCD** *Stamina Core Drain*
- **SD** *Stamina (Bar) Drain*
- **SR** *Stamina (Bar) Regen*

Name | HCD | SCD | SD | SR
:--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Boar Mother Hubbard | -22% | -20% | -50% | +20%
Alligator Ranch Cutter | -24% | -20% | -50% | +22%
Bear Dakota | -20% | -24% | -50% | +22%

Panther Trail | -20% | -26% | -50% | +24%
Cougar McClelland | -20% | -22% | -50% | +20%
Rattlesnake Vaquero | -22% | -24% | -50% | +24%
Nuevo Paraiso | -12% | -12% | -25% | +12%

### Traveling Long Distances Automatically
- Aside from fast travel (unlocked by purchasing the map from the camp ledger), you can autopilot to a destination: set a destination (must be in a road/path) on the map, hop on your horse and begin sprinting towards the waypoint. While sprinting, hold down the SELECT button (XB1) or X button (on PS4) to enter cinematic view. Black bars will appear and you will travel to the waypoint. **NOTE: events still occur, it's just a different camera view. You can still get attacked by a predator or enemies.

# GLITCHES

*The meaning of "glitch" is dependent upon a player's perspective on gameplay morality. Use these "glitches" at your discretion.*

### Steal Any Horse from Any Stable
*This works with all horses at every Stable. You must be able to buy the horse after it's unlocked. (Unlocking it puts the horse physically in the stable to be bought. For example, you can't steal an Amber Champagne MFT from Scarlett Meadows before Chapter 4.) Stealing horses in this manner doesn't reduce honor. Some Stables are easier to hit than others, though.*

1. Get any wagon or buggy. Larger ones are preferable.
2. Ride the wagon to the Stable which houses the horse you want to steal.
3. Put on your mask.
4. As you enter the Stable, pull out any gun, aim, and fire just as the horse enters the doors of the stable. Doing this prevents the Stable doors from closing.
5. Ensure you've at least one witness. It's necessary for this method.
6. Park the wagon between the Stable doors. (Again, to ensure they don't close.)
7. Hop off the wagon and go to the horse you want to steal.
8. You won't be able to mount the horse, so feed it using the **Horse Menu** until it registers as a **Temporary Horse**.
9. Hide until the witnesses/law stop searching. You can mount the horse just before the search ends to auto-enter the stable. If not, the black bars will appear and you'll enter horseless into the Stable.
10. Exit the stable, travel a ways away, and whistle for your temporary horse. Most of the time they will jump over the gates and run to you. If it doesn't come after a while, move around while continuing to call the horse.
12. Mount the horse and take it to any Stable, even the one you stole it from. Doesn't matter where.
12. Saddle up and enjoy your free horse!

### Universal Saddle Blankets
*Some Trapper saddles have unique blankets. This method does not work with two saddles which have thier own unique blankets. You can glitch the panther blanket with the Rattlesnake Vaquero Saddle but not with the Alligator Saddle.*

1. Enter a stable.
2. Equip the saddle which has the blanket you want to use.
3. Exit the stable.
4. Re-enter the stable.
5. Equip the saddle you want to use with the blanket.
6. Exit the stable.
7. Enjoy your Rattlesnake Saddle with a Panther blanket! (Or whichever combination you choose.)

### Getting the Silver Dapple Pinto Missouri Fox Trotter at No Cost for Arthur
1. *Save your game.*
2. Trigger the mission **Arcadia for Amateurs - III**. This does not work when replaying the mission.
3. When nearing the horses, enter **Eagle Eye** and track the Fox Trotter. Ensure you are tracking the correct horse. Sometimes its trail with be golden (like a Legendary Animal) and show up as *Unknown Animal*, but most of the time it'll show as **Herd** like the other horses.
4. Keep spamming Eagle Eye to maintain its trail. Just before you pass by Albert Mason, enter Eagle Eye one last time. This will extend the time you have to skip the cutscene before Eagle Eye cuts out.
5. Skip the cutscene immediately to end the mission as soon as possible. Eagle Eye deteriorates during the cutscene.
6. Continue Eagle Eye-ing the trail and follow it until you reach the horse. If the trail clips through the ground or becomes increasingly erratic, continue in the same direction you last saw the trail heading in. On all of my run throughs using this glitch, the Silver Dapple runs to **Elysian Pool**.
7. When you locate the horse, run alongside it and spam **Jump to Horse**. It will take some time because the horse is so jittery and you must be in perfect alignment to jump.
8. Tame the horse and bond it to **Level 1** via feeding.
9. DO NOT GET OFF OF THE HORSE. Ride it to the nearest **Stable**.
10. Stable the horse and saddle up your original horse.
11. Exit the stable, save the game, and reload.
12. Enjoy your free, wild **Silver Dapple Pinto Missouri Fox Trotter**! :)

### Saving Arthur's Money for John
The **Aberdeen Pig Farm** is inhabited by an incestual brother and sister, whom together work as a team of serial killers. There is a sort of side mission with these two: as either John or Arthur you can eat dinner with them. During which they'll offer some drinks. After drinking a few times, you pass out and wake up in their body dump site with no money. A decent backing for sticking to the story, I think, is: Arthur gets robbed, John reads about it in his journal, John goes to the farm and takes the money as it's of no use to Arthur at that point. :)

Go there and get robbed as Arthur right before the mission **"Red Dead Redemption"** (the last mission in which the player controls Arthur) but do not go back and kill them, nor get your money. Wait until you take control of John, travel to the farm, and retreive the cash from the safe behind the picture of "Mama" directly behind the front door. Kill or spare them as you see fit.

### Getting Out Of Map (Travel to Guarma/Mexico/Canada)
You'll need enough alcohol to blackout to do this. If you've got the **Wolf Heart Trinket**, you'll need a lot. Now, to get compendium entries and sketches as Arthur for animals specific to New Austin (and/or Guarma before/after of Chapter 5), or just to run around and explore, you can travel out of bounds via the far west end (at the edge of a drop-off) in the **Devil's Cave**. If you're running as John and want to explore the southern side out-of-map or travel to Guarma much quicker, an infinitely faster method is to travel to a specific point on the southern shore of the **San Luis River**.) Do the following once at either location:
1. Drink until you black out.
2. Do nondescript things while blacked out. (How the character gets up there whilst blackout drunk is unclear. Ah, the wonders of moonshine!)
3. Wake up out of map.

**GETTING TO GUARMA:** Guarma is located at the southeast (bottom right) corner of the map. Go in that general direction until you hit the low poly (jellytown) ground. Any low-poly area is considered the physical "end of the map" which you'll fall through. If you hit a 90-degree corner, turn on it (after turning you should be facing south). Follow the seam until you begin to float (walk up an invisible hill). Turn to face the low poly section, walk a few steps over the seam and Guarma's map will render in.

# HUNTING TIPS

### Difficult Animals
From what I've gathered while playing and word from other players, the most notoriously difficult-to-find animals are:
- Western Bull Moose
- Californian Horned Owl
- Small Birds (Robins, Woodpeckers, etc)
- Timber Wolf
- Cougars/Panthers

Below are individual tips listed for each.

### Moose Hunting Tips
- Prime locations with the most consistent spawns from my own and others' experience: Tall Trees, Colter, and Willard's Rest. Every other location has spawned a moose far less often than those three.
- There does not appear to be a specific time frame for spawns so far, but they definitely spawn most often in the early morning. Speculated prime time for spawn is 06:00-09:00, much like Elk, Deer, Pronghorn, and other "daytime" animals.
- Bait does not matter unless you just need moose pelts and not antlers. Both baits, regular and potent, do not affect the gender of the spawn. You can use up all the potent herbivore bait you want, you'll never spawn a bull moose from it. Both regular and potent herbivore baits spawn nothing but females of whatever animal it spawns. (Including elk, deer, ram/sheep, moose, etc.) There are videos online showing how to spawn a bull moose at Cairn Lake, but the spawn is not due to bait. Look at its star rating. Notice it actually has a rating? Animals spawned in by bait have no score and do not display a star rating when highlighted. Animals spawned by bait are pristine (a.k.a. three-star) by default. Also, that moose they "spawned" with bait is sitting down. Those videos just happened to hit the true wild random spawn purely by coincidence. Bait-spawned animals do not spawn in laying/sitting down.
- All wild spawn locations yield a male/female randomly. There's some serious RNG with moose spawns, and the odds are not in favor of the player. Either that, or they're broken completely.
- Approach the spawn slowly, from afar, on foot, and crouched. If the animal is not there, ensure you're a ways away from the spawn and slowly move your camera 360 degrees. This manipulates the spawns of all animals (works for everything, including moose).
- Tame and stable the **Perlino Andalusian** (east cliffside at **Brandywine Drop** in **ROANOKE RIDGE**). The horse being present either prevents or drastically lowers the chance of moose spawning at the location. Rare horses are limited to one per game session, meaning it will only respawn if it dies, is sold, or is set free in the wild. The entire time I've spent moose hunting, I've come to find not only do moose share spawnpoints with horses, they share elk spawnpoints as well. Prime examples: Willard's Rest, Brandywine Drop, Calumet Ravine, Cumberland Forest, and Lake Isabella. **DO NOT KILL THE ANIMAL THAT SPAWNS IN ITS PLACE.** This will prevent anything from spawning there until the corpse decomposes.
- Random events become essentially nonexistent post-story (epilogue), including moose encounters. Granted, I played at 100% completion with all story and stranger missions complete, but the last time I happened upon the random moose vs wolf event at Owanjila was... something like November 2020. On a new playthrough, I've encountered the random Owanjila moose twice as Arthur, once as John (in Epilogue 2). I'll check and see if they stop spawning at 100% when I hit it.

### Californian Horned Owl Hunting Tips
- Sleep until evening, then go out and watch the skies around **Armadillo** and **Cholla Springs**. Owls spawn flying overhead and standing on static spawns from 20:00-06:00.
- The Californian has allegedly been sighted around **Aurora Basin**, but I've yet to find one there myself. It does show up at **Bear Claw**, but not as often as the Great Horned. I've seen a ton of owls all around **Tall Trees**, but the Californian rarely shows up. It's more common in New Austin. That being said, **Bear Claw** in **Tall Trees** can have all three species of owl spawn flying over it: Coastal, Great Horned, and Californian.
- I'd check **Coots Chapel** before anywhere else.

### Timber Wolf Hunting Tips
- Gray Wolves are much more common in terms of covered area. Sometimes a pack may contain both Timber and Gray Wolves.
- You can find them across **Ambarino**, but I've had the best luck in **Cumberland Forest**, namely on the path east of **Firwood Rise**. Both Gray and Timber Wolves have numerous static spawnpoints given the player is riding nearby and the time is right. For the most part, evening to early morning, but late night is best. If you approach slowly and from afar when an NPC is riding by, a pack of three to six (sometimes more) wolves that will attack any NPC or animal in sight. I don't think direction of approach matters as I've found them at the southern path leading into **Cumberland Forest** coming from both north and south ends.
- Some insane pack action goes on south of **Fairwale Shanty**. I ran around in circles for thirty seconds right after the first pack spotted me and ended up with 15 wolves, a mix of Timber and Gray, chasing me. Supposedly (according to a number of people on GTAForums and Reddit) the more time you spend away from camp, the more wolves spawn in packs. (I've yet to confirm this.)

### Cougar/Panther Hunting Tips
- Use **Cover Scent Lotion** and crouch walk while hunting. This is crucial when stealth hunting these fuckers.
- Cougars and Panthers spawn both at static points and during random encounters from 20:00 to 06:00. (Nighttime... go figure.)
- Fire a shot and any aggressive animals in the immediate area will come to you. This includes Cougars, Bears, Panthers, etc. How that makes sense, I do not know.
- Having trouble studying them? Use a poison arrow, hit them in a non-critical area, and study them while they run away.
- Panthers are quick fucks, much faster during ambushes. Cougars are a bit slower, but they're both quick attackers.

### Bird Hunting Tips
- The best location I've found for farming small birds is **Fort Brennand**. I've found every bird there, including woodpeckers... every bird except for one: the **Hooded Oriole**. For that, make your way down the **Dakota River**. Orioles spawn on the West side of the map.
- Both species of **Woodpeckers** can be commonly found in **Black Bone Forest** as well as the woods all around **Cotorra Springs** and **Wapiti Indian Reservation**.
- **Condors** and **Vultures** are more common around **New Austin** than anywhere else. (Go figure.) The Western vulture *can* be found flying around **Bluewater Marsh**, despite implications.
- **Eagles** and **Hawks** can be found all around the map, but a hotspot is in **The Heartlands** all around **Twin Stack Pass**.
- **Horned Owls** can be found sporadically but essentially everywhere. A high concentration of all three species can be found around **Aurora Basin** and **Bear Claw**. The **Californian** can be found southwest of **Strawberry**, primarily in **New Austin**, while the **Coastal** and **Great** can be found essentially everywhere (random species by chance).

# MOOSE LOCATIONS

### Unverified Moose Locations

*These are locations which I've yet to encounter a moose at, but have either seen videos or read online of other people spotting moose there. Another case is if I vaguely recall seeing a moose there, but cannot cite for certain. (As in, early on shortly after I got this game but didn't know what I was doing.) This list will be updated as I progress through my playthroughs.*

- Adler Ranch, Grizzlies East, AM (there's an icon for it... might be for a cow Moose outside of Colter)
- Donner Falls, Grizzlies East, AM (cliff edge overlooking falls; possibly shared with grizzly spawn)
- Wallace Station, Big Valley, WE ("crossing train tracks south of Wallace Station"; unlikely)
- Cumberland Falls, Big Valley, WE (west shore cliffside just south of waterfall)
- Diablo Ridge, Big Valley, WE (riverside)
- Painted Sky, Big Valley, WE (riverside; vaguely recall seeing one shortly after I got the game; not one since then)
- Aurora Basin, Tall Trees, WE (southeast shoreline; I swear I've seen one on the SE shore of either **Aurora** or **Owanjila**)

### Verified Moose Locations

*"I seen some feller break a wild horse down by the falls yesterdee. This mornin' seen one uh them bull meese dern showed back up this mornin'..." ~ Murphy Brood*
*"You shut up about that!" ~ Rockstar Games*

*These are locations at which I've seen moose with my own eyes. In spawns that are shared with other animals, Moose do not hold priority. After an unimaginably boring time spent camping all these places, all spawns which are shared yield far less moose. Like... way less. I've seen a male/female moose one or twice at shared points. All of these are noted below.*

# MISSABLE CONTENT

Easier to win with temporary horse behind you (gets in their way). Winning these gives permanent stat boosts. (Permanent as in you retain the boost throughout the game on all horses you ride, even as John.)

### Ch.6
- **Owl Feather Trinket** from Rains Fall in **Archaeology for Beginners**. After choosing to help Rains Fall, you must retrieve the sacred items without killing any of the soldiers. Easiest way I've found of going about this is pistol whipping every man. Drink one Special Health Cure, then run around pistol whipping. One to two hits each and they're all out.

# JOURNAL ENTRY AND SKETCH DIFFERENCES
Arthur is a much more skilled draftsman than John. For the most part, Arthur's sketches and his wording when describing situations in journal entries are much more detailed. However there are exceptions.

# EASTER EGGS

### Skinner Brothers Yelps
The sounds made by **Skinner Brothers** during ambushes and attacks are the same made by **Wapiti Tribe** members during **My Last Boy**. Likely just a borrowed scare tactic, but the **Skinner Brothers** might have some other motive in doing this. Perhaps some members are tied to the tribe and are protecting land in **Tall Trees**. Or maybe it's just the former. In either case, the jumpscare potential is unreal. Trotting along the paths, you hear screaming out of nowhere but you know what's coming.

### Voices at Colter
Spooked by those voices before? Especially up at Colter where you know damn well there's no one else around?

When returning to previous Van der Linde camps, muffled voices can be heard speaking lines mentioned prior on the story. This happens at every previous camp, not just Colter. But hearing flashback voices up there, at night, no wind, no wolf howls, in the snow is a spooky experience.
