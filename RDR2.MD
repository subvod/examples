# RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 NOTES

*A collection of noted events and encounters, along with some observed numerical data.*

# SURVIVING IN THE WILDERNESS

Horses are the most efficient method of transportation in RDR2, therefore it is important to keep them healthy. That being said, you can still get around on foot quite well, just not nearly as fast. Without a horse, you'll be using up your own stamina core. Even at 100% completion (with all challenges, max stats, etc), surviving on foot is infinitely more difficult than with a horse.

Survival is pretty straightforward: eat things. However, some consumables provide greater benefit than others.

### The Basics

- **Big Game Meat** (harvested from **Alligators**, **Wolves**, **Grizzly Bears**, **Black Bears**, **Cougars**, and **Panthers**) fully restores all cores and, when seasoned, yields a gold core for the associated herb used for seasoning. (See below.)
- **Wild Mint** for *Health*
- **Oregano** for *Stamina*
- **Creeping Thyme** for *Dead Eye*
- **Wild Carrots** are the holy grail of horse upkeep.
- Weapons don't really matter unless you have a preference towards a certain gun or are going for clean kills. I run with: akimbo **LeMat Revolvers**, the **Bow**, and the **Varmint Rifle**. LeMats have super slow reload (which dead eye counteracts), yield high damage per round even with regular rounds, high capacity of 9 rounds, and have a secondary shotgun barrel allowing high damage up close in a revolver package. The Bow covers essentially everything for hunting. The Varmint Rifle covers the bow's middle ground: moderate sized animals. All the small mammals and large birds are iffy with the bow even with the Buck Antler Trinket.

### "Advanced" Survival
- **Horse Meal** yields both gold health and stamina cores for a day. The recipie pamphlet can be obtained in **Chapter 3** as a reward from Kieran for giving him Burdock Root. It requires (three of each) **Currant**, **Beets**, and **Hay** to craft. **Beets** and **Hay** can be looted from random campsites or bought from Stables. However the percentage of random campsites which spawn with these materials is incredibly low. Only one of either Beets or Hay will spawn in a **Basket**. One Horse Meal crafted from Beets and Hay bought from Stables costs $2.70 (versus the $5.00 **"Horse Care Package"** from Stables. Reasonably cheap, even without high honor discounts. In the long run, it's well worth the time spent traveling to a Stable to stock up on both. Now, the only ingredient that is *exclusively* found in the wild (cannot be purchased anywhere) is Currant. **Golden Currant** can be harvested in the northern half of **New Hanover**, while **Blackcurrant** is found all over **New Austin**.
- **Special Horse Reviver** and **Horse Ointment** are the only alternative (and only true "wilderness") methods of getting gold cores for your horse. The former requires (two of each) **Ginseng**, **Wild Carrot**, and **Parasol Mushroom**. The latter requires (one of each) **Sage**, **Common Bulrush**, and **Yarrow**. They are not bad tradeoffs for Horse Meal as they require less ingredients per batch. If you're keen on the "true wilderness" part of the game, go for these two. If you've got the time and money ($89.10 and two minutes to get 99 of each from a Stable) to buy Beets and Hay, Horse Meal holds the edge benefit/investment wise.
- **Poison Arrows** are key when needing to study and/or fend off aggressive animals. Crafting one requires one **Arrow**, one **Flight Feather**, and one **Oleander Sage** (found in the swamps and along the bank of the **Kamassa River** in **Lemoyne**). Hitting an aggressive animal with a Poison Arrow will cause it to flee, allowing you to study it as it runs away. Even better: spent Poison Arrows retain the poison and can be recollected and reused! (Unlike Poison Throwing Knives.)
- **Split Point Rounds** decrease dead eye drain, yield the same damage as "high velocity" rounds, and have increased accuracy. Taking the time to fill up your split point rounds makes a difference that you'll notice.
- **Potent Predator/Herbivore Bait** can help quite a bit if you're a stealth hunter. Potent Predator Bait requires berries (found everywhere) and gritty fish meat, which can be obtained from **Bluegill** (found everywhere, but a notably high population at **Calumet Ravine**) and/or **Bullhead Catfish** (bend of the Kamassa River west of Lagras, in addition to Lagras itself). **Potent Herbivore Bait** requires one **Vanilla Flower** (all around the swamps of Bayou Nwa), one **Violet Snowdrop** (high mountain and snowy regions, primarily in **Ambarino**), and one of any **Mushroom** (found across the map). You can craft regular Predator Bait from **Stringy Meat** and a **Berry**, but why not make the most of what you harvest?
- **Cover Scent Lotion** helps a ton in stealth hunting. You can craft it from the beginning of **Chapter 2** using **Scent Glands** from **Skunks**, **Beavers**, and **Muskrats**.
- **Animal Fat** isn't a necessity, but is required for **Explosive Rounds** (unlocked at beginning of **Chapter 2**) which are both fun to use and extremely useful when taking down legendary animals. **Canada Geese**, **Ducks** (not Loons), and **Beavers** are by far the best animals for this as they are plentiful in many areas across the map (north of New Austin), but **Boars/Pigs** and **Bears** also yield animal fat. Geese and ducks yield flight feathers (for all improved Arrow types) and animal fat while Beavers yield scent glands (for Cover Scent Lotion) and animal fat.
- **Campsites and Cabins/Shacks** inhabited/created by NPCs can house a ton of useful items. If you're not concerned about your honor, there are no rules.

### Honor And Benefits
If you can survive on your own (craft your own food/tonics/ammo) and don't care for the outfits only available with high honor, honor level in general makes no difference.
- With high honor, shops give up to a 50% discount (requires max high honor) on all items, as well as the ability to buy "high honor" outfits. Low honor does not affect shop prices positively nor negatively.
- With negative honor, you loot 4x more **Cocaine Gum** and **Chewing Tobacco** from bodies.
- Most story dialog changes based on honor level.
- In Chapter 6, actions that affect honor have a multiplier of 1.5x. Use this to your advantage if you run low honor as Arthur but want the "high honor" ending.

# GENERAL TIPS AND TRICKS

### Testing Tonics
Below is data gathered from testing **Potent Tonics** against their **Special** variants. Testing was done by sprinting or entering dead eye right after consuming the associated items. Time was clocked when the bar was fully used up and the gold core fully depleted.

#### Stamina
1. Oregano Big Game + Special Bitters
- 01:54:04
2. Oregano Big Game + Potent Bitters
- 01:42:87

#### Dead Eye
1. Thyme Big Game + Special Snake Oil
- 0:44:21
2. Thyme Big Game + Potent Snake Oil
- 0:41:68
As you can see, **Special Bitters** makes a bit of a difference, where as **Special Snake Oil** does fairly little in terms of better fortification. Health testing is tricky...

### Fast Weapon Familiarity
- Raid enemy camps and use dead eye to get headshots.

### Fast Level 4 Bonding Horses
- Leading your horse yields more bonding points per minute than anything else.
- The old rubber band trick works for this:
1. Begin leading your horse.
2. Travel to the open fields of **The Heartlands**.
3. Wrap a rubber band around your thumbstick and the end of either palm grip (depending on the length of the rubber band).
4. Do other things for a while. (About 20 minutes.)
5. Come back to your fully bonded horse.
- THIS IDLE METHOD DOESN'T ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF HOSTILITY FROM BOUNTY HUNTERS, BUSHWHACKERS, ROBBERS, AGGRESSIVE ANIMALS, ETC. MIGHT WANT TO PEEK AT THE SCREEN EVERY NOW AND THEN AND/OR KEEP AN EAR OUT.

### Map Icons
- Animal drawings are added when an animal is both studied and tracked in specific areas. The best thing to do is study and track everything you come across. Additional locations will be marked as animals are "sighted" (moving the crosshair to highlight them). Looking at animals through binoculars (after studying) is by far the most efficient way to populate the map with animal icons.
- Plant drawings are added when a plant is studied and picked/eaten in specific areas. Best to pick everything you come across.
- Point of interest, dreamcatcher, dinosaur bone, and rock carving locations are added when they are "investigated".

### Triggering Pearson's Rabbit Request to Obtain the Unique Scout Jacket
- A number of players claim to have activated it in Chapters 3 and 4, but most people, including myself, have only activated it in Chapter 2.
- Pearson will be drinking beer at his wagon's table. When you walk near him, it will only give a **Greet** prompt when the request is available for activation.

### Saddles
- **HCD** *Health Core Drain*
- **SCD** *Stamina Core Drain*
- **SD** *Stamina (Bar) Drain*
- **SR** *Stamina (Bar) Regen*

Name | HCD | SCD | SD | SR
:--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Boar Mother Hubbard | -22% | -20% | -50% | +20%
Alligator Ranch Cutter | -24% | -20% | -50% | +22%
Bear Dakota | -20% | -24% | -50% | +22%
Beaver Roping | -26% | -20% | -50% | +24%
Panther Trail | -20% | -26% | -50% | +24%
Cougar McClelland | -20% | -22% | -50% | +20%
Rattlesnake Vaquero | -22% | -24% | -50% | +24%
Nuevo Paraiso | -12% | -12% | -25% | +12%

There is no definitive "best saddle", it all depends upon personal preference. I go for the Beaver Roping Saddle because it provides the highest Stamina Regen and Health Core Drain bonuses. (My reasoning behind this is: horse health core drain intensifies when they're dirty. And who doesn't want less stamina drain?)

### Traveling Long Distances Automatically
- Aside from fast travel (unlocked by purchasing the map from the camp ledger), you can autopilot to a destination: set a destination (must be in a road/path) on the map, hop on your horse and begin sprinting towards the waypoint. While sprinting, hold down the SELECT button (XB1) or X button (on PS4) to enter cinematic view. Black bars will appear and you will travel to the waypoint. **NOTE: events still occur, it's just a different camera view. You can still get attacked by a predator or enemies.

# GLITCHES

*The meaning of "glitch" is dependent upon a player's perspective on gameplay morality. Use these "glitches" at your discretion.*

### Steal Any Horse from Any Stable
*This works with all horses at every Stable. You must be able to buy the horse after it's unlocked. (Unlocking it puts the horse physically in the stable to be bought. For example, you can't steal an Amber Champagne MFT from Scarlett Meadows before Chapter 4.) Stealing horses in this manner doesn't reduce honor. Some Stables are easier to hit than others, though.*

1. Get any wagon or buggy. Larger ones are preferable.
2. Ride the wagon to the Stable which houses the horse you want to steal.
3. Put on your mask.
4. As you enter the Stable, pull out any gun, aim, and fire just as the horse enters the doors of the stable. Doing this prevents the Stable doors from closing.
5. Ensure you've at least one witness. It's necessary for this method.
6. Park the wagon between the Stable doors. (Again, to ensure they don't close.)
7. Hop off the wagon and go to the horse you want to steal.
8. You won't be able to mount the horse, so feed it using the **Horse Menu** until it registers as a **Temporary Horse**.
9. Hide until the witnesses/law stop searching. You can mount the horse just before the search ends to auto-enter the stable. If not, the black bars will appear and you'll enter horseless into the Stable.
10. Exit the stable, travel a ways away, and whistle for your temporary horse. Most of the time they will jump over the gates and run to you. If it doesn't come after a while, move around while continuing to call the horse.
12. Mount the horse and take it to any Stable, even the one you stole it from. Doesn't matter where.
12. Saddle up and enjoy your free horse!

### Universal Saddle Blankets
Some saddles crafted by the Trapper have unique blankets. To use a blanket from one saddle with a different saddle:

1. Enter a stable.
2. Equip the saddle which has the blanket you want to use.
3. Exit the stable.
4. Re-enter the stable.
5. Equip the saddle you want to use with the blanket.
6. Exit the stable.
7. Enjoy your Rattlesnake Saddle with a Panther blanket! (Or whichever combination you choose.)

### Getting the Silver Dapple Pinto Missouri Fox Trotter at No Cost for Arthur
1. *Save your game.*
2. Trigger the mission **Arcadia for Amateurs - III**.
3. When nearing the horses, enter **Eagle Eye** and track the Fox Trotter. Ensure you are tracking the correct horse. Sometimes it will show up as *Unknown Animal*, but most of the time it'll show as **Herd** like the other horses.
4. Keep spamming Eagle Eye to maintain its trail. Just before you pass by Albert Mason, enter Eagle Eye one last time.
5. Skip the cutscene immediately to end the mission as soon as possible. Eagle Eye deteriorates during the cutscene.
6. Continue Eagle Eye-ing the trail and follow it until you reach the horse. On all of my run throughs, the Silver Dapple runs to **Elysian Pool**.
7. When you locate the horse, run alongside it and spam **Jump to Horse**. It will take some time because the horse is so jittery and you must be in perfect alignment to jump.
8. Tame the horse and bond it to **Level 1**.
9. DO NOT GET OFF OF THE HORSE. Ride it to the nearest **Stable**.
10. Stable the horse and saddle up your original horse.
11. Exit the stable, save the game, and reload.
12. Enjoy your free, wild **Silver Dapple Pinto Missouri Fox Trotter**! :)

### Saving Arthur's Money for John
The **Aberdeen Pig Farm** is inhabited by an incestual brother and sister, whom together work as a team of serial killers. There is a sort of side mission with these two: as either John or Arthur you can eat dinner with them. During which they'll offer some drinks. After drinking a few times, you pass out and wake up in their body dump site with no money. A decent backing for sticking to the story, I think, is: Arthur gets robbed, John reads about it in his journal, John goes to the farm and takes the money as it's of no use to Arthur at that point. :)

Go there and get robbed as Arthur right before the mission **"Red Dead Redemption"** (the last mission in which the player controls Arthur) but do not go back and kill them, nor get your money. Wait until you take control of John, travel to the farm, and retreive the cash from the safe behind the picture of "Mama" directly behind the front door. Kill or spare them as you see fit.

### Getting Out Of Map (Travel to Guarma/Mexico/Canada)
You'll need a bit of alcohol to do this. If you've got the **Wolf Heart Trinket**, you'll need a lot. Now, to get compendium entries and sketches as Arthur for animals specific to New Austin (and/or Guarma before/after of Chapter 5), or just to run around and explore, you can travel out of bounds via the far west end (at the edge of a drop-off) in the **Devil's Cave**. If you're running as John and want to explore the southern side out-of-map or travel to Guarma much quicker, an infinitely faster method is to travel to a specific point on the southern shore of the **San Luis River**.) Do the following once at either location:
1. Drink until you black out.
2. Do nondescript things while blacked out. (How the character gets up there whilst blackout drunk is unclear. Ah, the benefits of moonshine!)
3. Wake up out of map.

**GETTING TO GUARMA:** Guarma is located at the southeast (bottom right) corner of the map. Go in that general direction until you hit the low poly (jellytown) ground. If you hit a 90-degree corner, turn on it (after turning you should be facing south). Follow the seam until you begin to float (walk up an invisible hill). Turn to face the low poly section, walk a few steps over the seam and Guarma's map will render in.

# HUNTING TIPS

### Difficult Animals
From what I've gathered while playing and word from other players, the most notoriously difficult-to-find animals are:
- Western Bull Moose
- Californian Horned Owl
- Small Birds (Robins, Woodpeckers, etc)
- Timber Wolf
- Cougars/Panthers

Below are individual tips listed for each.

### Moose Hunting Tips
- Prime locations with the most consistent spawns from my own and others' experience: Tall Trees, Colter, and Willard's Rest. Every other location has spawned a moose far less often than those three.
- There does not appear to be a specific time frame for spawns so far, but they definitely spawn most often in the daytime. Speculated prime time for spawn is 06:00-18:00, much like Elk, Deer, Pronghorn, and other "daytime" animals.
- Bait does not matter unless you just need moose pelts and not antlers. Both baits, regular and potent, do not affect the gender of the spawn. You can use up all the potent herbivore bait you want, you'll never spawn a bull moose from it. Both regular and potent herbivore baits spawn nothing but females of whatever animal it spawns. (Including elk, deer, ram/sheep, moose, etc.) There are videos online showing how to spawn a bull moose at Cairn Lake, but the spawn is not due to bait. Look at its star rating. Notice it actually has a rating? Animals spawned in by bait have no score and do not display a star rating when highlighted. Animals spawned by bait are pristine (a.k.a. three-star) by default. Also, that moose they "spawned" with bait is sitting down. Those videos just happened to hit the true wild random spawn purely by coincidence. Bait-spawned animals do not spawn in laying/sitting down.
- All wild spawn locations yield a male/female randomly. There's some serious RNG with moose spawns, and the odds are not in favor of the player. Either that, or they're broken completely.
- Approach the spawn slowly, from afar, on foot, and crouched. If the animal is not there, ensure you're a ways away from the spawn and slowly move your camera 360 degrees. This manipulates the spawns of all animals (works for everything, including moose).
- Tame and stable the **White Arabian** (at **Lake Isabella**) and **Perlino Andalusian** (east cliffside at **Brandywine Drop** in **ROANOKE RIDGE**). A rare horse being present either prevents or drastically lowers the chance of moose spawning at the location. You might want to stable the **Red Chestnut Arabian** (atop a hill west of **Owanjila**) as well.) Just tame and stable them. They're limited to one per game session, meaning it will only respawn if it dies, is sold, or is set free in the wild. The entire time I've spent moose hunting, I've come to find not only do moose share spawnpoints with horses, they share elk spawnpoints as well. Prime examples: Willard's Rest, Brandywine Drop, Calumet Ravine, Cumberland Forest, and Lake Isabella. **DO NOT KILL THE ANIMAL THAT SPAWNS IN ITS PLACE.** This will prevent anything from spawning there until the corpse decomposes.
- Random events become essentially nonexistent post-story (epilogue), including moose encounters. Granted, I played at 100% completion with all story and stranger missions complete, but the last time I happened upon the random moose vs wolf event at Owanjila was... something like November 2020. On a new playthrough, I've encountered the random Owanjila moose twice as Arthur, once as John (in Epilogue 2). I'll check and see if they stop spawning at 100% when I hit it.

### Californian Horned Owl Hunting Tips
- Sleep until evening, then go out and watch the skies around **Armadillo** and **Cholla Springs**. Owls spawn flying from 20:00-06:00.
- The Californian has allegedly been sighted around **Aurora Basin**, but I've yet to find one there myself. I've seen a ton of owls there, just not the Californian.
- **Bear Claw** in **Tall Trees** can have all three species of owl spawn flying over it.

### Timber Wolf Hunting Tips
- Gray Wolves are much more common in terms of covered area. Sometimes a pack may contain both Timber and Gray Wolves.
- You can find them across **Ambarino**, but I've had the best luck in **Cumberland Forest**, namely on the path east of **Firwood Rise**. If you approach slowly and from afar when an NPC is riding by, there's a pack of four wolves (every time I've come here it's been four Timbers) that will attack any NPC or animal in sight. I don't think direction matters as I've found them here coming from both north and south.
- Some insane pack action goes on south of **Fairwale Shanty**. I ran around in circles for thirty seconds right after the first pack spotted me and ended up with 15 wolves, a mix of Timber and Gray, chasing me. Supposedly the more time you spend away from camp, the more wolves spawn in packs. (I've yet to confirm this.)

### Cougar/Panther Hunting Tips
- Cougars and Panthers spawn at all times from static points, but the likelihood of spawning increases drastically from 20:00 to 06:00. (Nighttime... go figure.)
- Fire a shot and any aggressive animals in the immediate area will come to you. How that makes sense, I do not know.
- Having trouble studying them? Use a poison arrow, hit them in a non-critical area, and study them while they run away.

### Small Bird Hunting Tips
- The best location I've found for farming small birds is **Fort Brennand**. I've found every bird there, including woodpeckers... every bird except for one: the **Hooded Oriole**. For that, make your way down the **Dakota River**.
- **Woodpeckers** can be commonly found in **Black Bone Forest** as well as the woods all around **Cotorra Springs** and **Wapiti Indian Reservation**.
- **Condors** and **Vultures** are more common around **New Austin** than anywhere else. (Go figure.)
- **Eagles** and **Hawks** can be found all around **The Heartlands**, especially near **Twin Stack Pass**.
- **Owls** can be found sporadically but essentially everywhere. A high concentration can be found around **Aurora Basin**.

- **Owl Feather Trinket** from Rains Fall in **Archaeology for Beginners**. After choosing to help Rains Fall, you must retrieve the sacred items without killing any of the soldiers. Easiest way I've found of going about this is pistol whipping every man. Drink one Special Health Cure, then run around pistol whipping. One to two hits each and they're all out.

# JOURNAL ENTRY AND SKETCH DIFFERENCES
Arthur is a much more skilled draftsman than John. For the most part, Arthur's sketches and his wording when describing situations in journal entries are much more detailed. However there are exceptions.

### Sketches by Arthur That Appear as Basic as John's

# EASTER EGGS

### Skinner Brothers Yelps
The sounds made by **Skinner Brothers** during ambushes and attacks are the same made by **Wapiti Tribe** members during **My Last Boy**. Likely just a borrowed scare tactic, but the **Skinner Brothers** might have some other motive in doing this. Perhaps some members are tied to the tribe and are protecting land in **Tall Trees**. Or maybe it's just the former. In either case, the jumpscare potential is unreal. Trotting along the paths, you hear screaming out of nowhere but you know what's coming.

### Voices at Colter
Spooked by those voices before? Especially up at Colter where you know damn well there's no one else around?

When returning to previous Van der Linde camps, muffled voices can be heard speaking lines mentioned prior on the story. This happens at every previous camp, not just Colter. But hearing flashback voices up there, at night, no wind, no wolf howls, in the snow is a spooky experience.
