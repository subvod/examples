# SURVIVING IN THE WILDERNESS

You're better off with a horse, but it's certainly possible to survive on your own. Survival is pretty straightforward: kill things, collect things, and eat said things. Some consumables provide greater benefit than others and/or are only available in certain regions.

### The Basics
*NOTE: nothing grows up in the Northwestern snow-covered areas of Ambarino.*

- Cooked meats refill all cores according to the type of meat. The best combo of store-bought items I've found is **Baked Beans** and **Fine Brandy**. For wild meats, aside from **Big Game** (the best cut; see below in "Advanced Survival"), the most nutritious cuts are: **Venison**, **Pork**, **Game**, **Succulent Fish**, **Prime Beef**, and **Exotic Bird**. The most common animals for these cuts are **Deer**, **Pronghorn**, **Elk**, **Duck**, and **Rabbit**. Though, **Moose**, **Wild Boar**, **Collard Peccary**, **Domestic Pigs**, **Bison**, **Ox**, **Bull**, **Cow**, **Pheasant**, **Pelican**, **Macaw (Parrot)**, **Carolina Parakeet**, **Sockeye Salmon**, and **Rainbow Trout** all yield meats that greatly restore all cores. When seasoned, these meats fully restore the core associated with the herb used.
- **Wild Carrots** are the holy grail of horse upkeep. They grow everywhere. Yes, there are two different carrots. You cannot use bought/looted regular **Carrots** in crafting recipes, but they provide the same benefits as **Wild Carrots**. If you're not big on harvesting **Wild Carrots** yourself, farmed **Carrots** are available for purchase at Stables. However if you buy provisions from a Stable, **Hay** is the far superior choice as it is the cheapest cost-per-benefit.
- Weapon loadout doesn't really matter unless you have a preference towards a certain gun or are going for clean kills. I run with: akimbo **Semi Auto Pistols**, shouldered **Bow**, and crossback **Varmint Rifle**. Semi Autos allow for lightning fast quickdraw/deadeye kills. The **Bow** covers essentially everything for hunting aside from its middle ground: "moderate" sized animals. The **Varmint Rifle** covers this middle ground: Iguanas, Gila Monsters, Opossums, Beavers, Badgers, Skunks, Raccoons, and all large birds (Owls, Hawks, Eagles, Cranes, Egrets, Condors, Vultures/Buzzards, Herons, etc). Even with the **Buck Antler Trinket**, if you land a headshot with a regular arrow on any of these (and would like to sell the carcass whole), the carcass will always be a 2-star. However, if you skin/pluck the same animal (example: Owl headshot with regular arrow) you'll get the items to use/sell as if it were a 3-star. If I'd no plans to preserve/sell whole carcasses and skin/pluck everything I came across, I can run just the Bow as my single primary. However, it's at the player's discretion. It's an open world for a reason.
- All **Rams**, **Whitetail Bucks**, and **Bull Elk** will charge and headbutt you even if you're facing them. All snakes on land will bit you if you get too close to  them. There's really no trick to not getting headbutted other than outrunning the animal or killing/spooking it, and that's only if you see it before it happens.
- For snake bites or ingested **Oleander**, drink a **Potent or Special Health Cure**. Regular **Health Cures** do not cure venom/poison.

### "Advanced" Survival
- If you don't care about honor, there's a shortcut to getting mass quantities of a few select herbs. Rather than go around gathering each one at a time, kill and loot **Murphy Brood** in northwestern **Heartlands** and **Strangers** (residents) at **Butcher Creek**. **Skinner Brothers** in **Tall Trees** and **Nite Folk** in **Bayou Nwa** can have up to four **Burdock Root**, but no other plants. The aforementioned (Murphy Brood and Butcher Creek residents) all have a chance of holding 2 to 4 units of **Currant**, **Sage**, **Ginseng**, **Violet Snowdrop**, or **Burdock Root**. They also have a chance of giving other items: **Regular/Potent Snake Oil** (only from **Murphy Brood**), regular **Herbivore/Predator Bait**, **Opened/Unopened Cover Scent**, and **Moonshine** (only from **Butcher Creek Residents**).
- **Gold Cores** for the player come in handy, and maintaining cores is a key part in RDR2. Player cores can be gilded (made golden) with **Big Game Meat** (harvested from **Alligators**, **Wolves**, **Grizzly Bears**, **Black Bears**, **Cougars**, and **Panthers**) seasoned with the corresponding herb (**Wild Mint** found around rivers/creeks/lakes for *Health*, **Oregano** found near forested areas for *Stamina*, and **Thyme** found in open areas for *Dead Eye*). **Seasoned Big Game Meat** fully restores all cores and yields a gold core for the associated herb used for seasoning lasting 24 in-game hours.
- **Gold Cores** for the player's horse are immensely beneficial, whether often in firefights or trotting around large distances. **Horse Meal** yields both gold health and stamina cores for a day. The recipie pamphlet can be obtained in **Chapter 3** as a reward for Kieran's item request of Burdock Root. It requires three of each **Currant**, **Beets**, and **Hay** to craft. **Currant** has two variants: **Golden Currant** (all over the northern half of **New Hanover**; also **Tall Trees** and **Great Plains**) and **Blackcurrant** (west of Armadillo). **Beets** and **Hay** can be looted from random NPC campsites/wagons or bought from **Stables**. However the percentage of random campsites/wagons which spawn with these materials is quite infrequent, and even then you'll be taking a gamble. You may get only one of either Beets or Hay at each if you even get either of them. These same campsites/wagons may spawn Celery, Peach, Apple, Pear, etc. Be that as it may, one Horse Meal crafted from Beets and Hay bought from Stables costs $2.70 (versus the $5.00 **"Horse Care Package"** from Stables). Reasonably cheaper than the latter even with high honor discounts. In the long run, it's well worth the time spent traveling to a Stable to stock up on both for making Horse Meal on-the-go. However **Wild Carrots** work just fine, you just have to feed your horse slightly more often.
- **Special Horse Reviver** and **Horse Ointment** are the only alternative and only true "wilderness" methods of getting gold cores for your horse. The former requires (two of each) **Ginseng**, **Wild Carrot**, and **Parasol Mushroom**. The latter requires (one of each) **Sage**, **Common Bulrush**, and **Yarrow**. They are not bad tradeoffs for Horse Meal as they require less (but more various) ingredients per batch. If you're keen on the "true wilderness" part of the game, go for these two. If you've got the time and money to head into town and stock up on **Beets** and **Hay** ($89.10 and one minute to get 99 of both from a Stable), **Horse Meal** holds the edge benefit/investment wise. *NOTE: HORSE OINTMENT DOES NOT CLEAN YOUR HORSE. YOU'LL STILL HAVE TO BRUSH IT IF IT GETS DIRTY.*
- **Poison Arrows** works wonders in combat, but are also key when needing to study and/or fend off aggressive animals. Crafting one requires one **Arrow**, one **Flight Feather**, and one **Oleander Sage** (found in the swamps and along the bank of the **Kamassa River** in **Lemoyne**). Hitting anything with a Poison Arrow will cause it to flee, allowing you to study animals as they run away. Even better: spent **Poison Arrows** retain the poison and can be recollected and reused, unlike **Poison Throwing Knives**.
- **Split Point Rounds** decrease dead eye drain, yield the same damage as "high velocity" rounds, and have increased accuracy. Taking the time to fill up your split point rounds makes a difference that you'll notice. Also, in pure speculation with no numbers to back it up: I feel like split point rounds yield more critical hits overall versus regular/high velocity/express rounds.
- **Potent Predator/Herbivore Bait** can help quite a bit if you're a stealth hunter. Potent Predator Bait requires a berry (found everywhere) and gritty fish meat, which can be obtained from **Bluegill** (found everywhere, but a notably high population at **Calumet Ravine**), **Bullhead Catfish** (bend of the Kamassa River west of Lagras, in addition to Lagras itself), and/or **Longnose Gar** (found exclusively in **Lagras**). **Potent Herbivore Bait** requires one **Vanilla Flower** (all around the swamps of Bayou Nwa), one **Violet Snowdrop** (high mountain and snowy regions, primarily in **Ambarino**), and one of any **Mushroom** (found across the map). You can craft regular Predator Bait from **Stringy Meat** and a **Berry**, but why not make the most of what you harvest and stick with potent?
- **Cover Scent Lotion** allows you to get way closer to animals without drawing their attention. Craft it from the beginning of **Chapter 2** using **Scent Glands** from **Skunks**, **Beavers**, and **Muskrats**.
- **Flight Feathers** are required for every secondary arrow type and can be harvested from all flying birds.
- **Animal Fat** isn't a necessity, but is required for **Explosive Rounds** (unlocked at beginning of **Chapter 2**) which are both fun to use and extremely useful when taking down legendary animals. **Canada Geese**, **Ducks** (not Loons), and **Beavers** are by far the best animals for this as they are plentiful in many areas across the map (north of New Austin), but **Boars/Pigs/Peccary** and **Bears** also yield animal fat. **Geese** and **Ducks** yield **Flight Feathers** (for all improved **Arrow** types) and **Animal Fat** while **Beavers** yield **Scent Glands** (for **Cover Scent Lotion**) and **Animal Fat**. *NOTE: A PRIME LOCATION FOR GEESE, DUCKS, AND BEAVERS IS OWANJILA.*

### Honor And Benefits
Surviving on your own is quite easy, cooking food and crafting tonics/ammo. That being said, if you don't care for the outfits only available with high honor, honor level in general makes no difference. However honor level does affect some aspects of the game:
- Shops give a discount (up to 50% with max high honor) on all items, as well as the ability to buy "high honor" outfits. Honor at or lower than neutral (0) does not affect shop prices.
- With maximum negative honor, the ambient sounds of deadeye change.
- Most story dialog changes based on honor level.
- Arthur and John's mannerisms change based on honor. Example: when pulling a gun, saying "don't make me do this" with high honor versus "I will kill you right here" with low honor.
- In Chapter 6, actions that affect honor have a multiplier of 1.5x. Use this to your advantage if you run low honor as Arthur but want the "high honor" ending.

# GENERAL TIPS AND TRICKS

### Testing Tonics
Below is data gathered from testing **Potent Tonics** against their **Special** variants. Testing was done by sprinting or entering dead eye right after consuming the associated items. Time was clocked when the bar was fully used up and the gold core fully depleted.

#### Stamina
1. Oregano Big Game + Special Bitters
- 01:54:04
2. Oregano Big Game + Potent Bitters
- 01:42:87

#### Dead Eye
1. Thyme Big Game + Special Snake Oil
- 0:44:21
2. Thyme Big Game + Potent Snake Oil
- 0:41:68

As you can see, **Special Bitters** makes a bit of a difference, where as **Special Snake Oil** does fairly little in terms of better fortification. Overall, if you're short on materials, bought/crafted Potent tonics will do just fine in most situations.

### Fast Weapon Familiarity
- Use dead eye to get headshots.

### Fast Level 4 Bonding Horses
- Leading your horse yields more bonding points per minute than anything else. The old rubber band trick works for this:
1. Begin leading your horse.
2. Travel to the open fields of **The Heartlands**. Alternatively you can go to the plains west of Blackwater, but there are more snakes out that way. (Getting close to any aggressive animal will end the lead.)
3. Wrap a rubber band around your thumbstick and the end of either palm grip (depending on the length of the rubber band).
4. Do other things for a while. (About 20 minutes.)
5. Come back to your fully bonded horse.

- *THIS IDLE METHOD DOESN'T ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF HOSTILITY FROM BOUNTY HUNTERS, BUSHWHACKERS, ROBBERS, AGGRESSIVE ANIMALS, ETC. MIGHT WANT TO PEEK AT THE SCREEN EVERY NOW AND THEN AND/OR KEEP AN EAR OUT.*
- *If on the PC version without a controller, you can use [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to simulate holding down the movement key(s).*

### Map Icons
- Here's the map I use for reference: https://gtaforums.com/topic/968364-complete-map-with-all-discoverable-icons/
- Animal drawings are added when an animal is sighted in a specific area. It must be both studied and tracked at least once to add icons the the overworld map. The best thing to do is study and track everything you come across. Hell, I even kill everything I see because why not? Additional locations will be marked as animals are "sighted" (moving the crosshair to highlight them). Looking at animals through binoculars (after studying and tracking at least one to fill the compendium) is by far the most efficient way to populate the map with animal icons. Though, I personally just run around killing everything with **Poison Arrows**. :)
- Plant drawings are added when a plant is picked/eaten at least once in the immediate area of the icon. Best to pick everything you come across because spawning a plant with a trainer and picking it does not add the icon for some reason.
- Point of interest, dreamcatcher, dinosaur bone, and rock carving locations are added when they are "investigated".

### Triggering Pearson's Rabbit Request to Obtain the Unique Scout Jacket
- It's available from Ch.2 to Ch.6.
- Pearson will be drinking beer at his wagon's table. When you walk near him, it will only give a **Greet** prompt when the request is available for activation (like every other request).
- I ran around camp in Ch.2 for 15 minutes real time and never got the request (had full cores the whole time). I went to camp in Ch.3 after consuming Moonshine, Cocaine Gum, and Chewing Tobacco to completely deplete my cores and voila, requested right as I walk into camp! Maybe coincidental, I've no numbers for solid proof this works. But if it is just coincidence, it's one hell of a coincidence. Also tested in Ch. 2. Took about 20 minutes, but those 20 minutes are nothing compared to a few hours total spend entering/exiting camp to get him to spawn there. It's worth a shot. :)

### Alcohol

*Below is a list of alcohol values per item. Value amounts to "proof*. Higher proof means drunk quicker.

Name | Value
:--- | ---
Saloon Beer | 0.1
Saloon Whiskey | 0.1
Opened Guarma Rum | 0.1
Opened Fine Brandy | 0.1
Opened Gin | 0.1
Opened Kentucky Bourbon | 0.13
Guarma Rum | 0.17
Fine Brandy | 0.17
Gin | 0.17
Kentucky Bourbon | 0.25
Moonshine | 0.3
Whiskey Bottle | 0.4
Aged Pirate Rum | 0.5

### Saddles

There is no definitive "best all around saddle", it all depends upon personal preference. I go for the **Panther Trail Saddle** because it looks the best on my Amber Champagne MFT. (The looks are the worth the 4% compromise to me.) However, the **Beaver Roping Saddle** is technically the "best" saddle solely in terms of game logic because it provides the highest Stamina Regen (same as **Panther** and **Rattlesnake** saddles) and **Health Core Drain** bonuses. My reasoning behind this is: horse health core drain intensifies when they're dirty. I don't brush my horse often, so a lot of times it's just dirty. That being the case, the occasional health core penalty is lowered that much more with the Beaver Saddle.

- **HCD** *Health Core Drain*
- **SCD** *Stamina Core Drain*
- **SD** *Stamina (Bar) Drain*
- **SR** *Stamina (Bar) Regen*

Name | HCD | SCD | SD | SR
:--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Boar Mother Hubbard | -22% | -20% | -50% | +20%
Alligator Ranch Cutter | -24% | -20% | -50% | +22%
Bear Dakota | -20% | -24% | -50% | +22%
Beaver Roping | -26% | -20% | -50% | +24%
Panther Trail | -20% | -26% | -50% | +24%
Cougar McClelland | -20% | -22% | -50% | +20%
Rattlesnake Vaquero | -22% | -24% | -50% | +24%
Nuevo Paraiso | -12% | -12% | -25% | +12%

### Traveling Long Distances Automatically
- Aside from fast travel (unlocked by purchasing the map from the camp ledger), you can autopilot to a destination: set a destination (must be in a road/path) on the map, hop on your horse and begin sprinting towards the waypoint. While sprinting, hold down the SELECT button (XB1) or X button (on PS4) to enter cinematic view. Black bars will appear and you will travel to the waypoint. **NOTE: events still occur, it's just a different camera view. You can still get attacked by a predator or enemies.

### Looting saddle bags and not getting kicked in the face.
1. Hop on the horse you want to loot.
2. Ride/lead the horse right next to any static entity that will partially block you phsically digging through the saddle bag, be it a tree, rock/boulder, wagon, train, etc. Ensure after you hop off that the **Search Saddle Bag** prompt is still there.
3. Search the saddle bag.
4. Enjoy your saddle bag loot never having to get kicked in the face ever again.

### Farming gritty fish meat for potent predator bait.
- Fish off of the docks around **Lagras** during rainy weather. Neither **Rock Bass** nor **Perch** spawn around **Lagras**, so you've not to worry about snagging one of those bastards. On the flip side, you may get **Smallmouth/Largemouth Bass**, **Chain Pickerel**, and/or **Lake Sturgeon**. Another plus is **Bullhead Catfish**, **Channel Catfish**, and **Longnose Gar** also spawn around there, all of which yield **Gritty Fish Meat**.

# GLITCHES, BUGS, AND CHEATS
These are all the bugs/glitches/cheats I found notable. Some are bad, some are good.

*The meaning of "cheat" is dependent upon a player's perspective on gameplay morality. The player can choose whether or not to use "cheats" at their own discretion. A "bug" or "glitch" is anything that isn't meant to happen.*

### Double Skins from Animals
*If an animal can be carried, this glitch can be used for it. Basically everything but Meese, Elk, (big) Alligators, Bison, Boars/Javelinas, Bears, etc, and all small game like squirrels, small birds, toads/frogs, etc.*

*This is noted in the Hunting Tips section, but I'm on the borderline between it being a glitch or not. There's no semi-abnormal thing to this like there is with un-scoping the Rolling Block and Carcano. Nonetheless, here it is.*

1. Skin an animal.
2. Stow the skin if applicable.
3. Pick up and stow the skinned carcass on your horse.
4. Ride to a Trapper, Butcher, or Pearson (at camp).
5. Sell/donate the skinned carcass and skin itself. It will count as two skins, and you'll also get the +2 in the Compendium. That's how I have skinned 42 Californian Owls but killed only 21. :)

### Steal Any Horse from Any Stable
*This works with all horses at every Stable. You must be able to buy the horse after it's unlocked. (Unlocking it puts the horse physically in the stable to be bought. For example, you can't steal an Amber Champagne MFT from Scarlett Meadows before Chapter 4.) Stealing horses in this manner doesn't reduce honor. Some Stables are easier to hit than others, though.*

1. Get any wagon or buggy. Larger ones are preferable.
2. Ride the wagon to the Stable which houses the horse you want to steal.
3. Put on a mask/bandana.
4. As you enter the Stable, pull out any gun, aim, and fire just as the horse enters the doors of the stable. Doing this prevents the Stable doors from closing.
5. Ensure you've at least one witness. It's necessary for this method.
6. Park the wagon between the Stable doors. (Again, to ensure they don't close.)
7. Hop off the wagon and go to the horse you want to steal.
8. You won't be able to mount the horse, so feed it using the **Horse Menu** until it registers as a **Temporary Horse**.
9. Hide until the witnesses/law stop searching. You can mount the horse just before the search ends to auto-enter the stable. If not, the black bars will appear and you'll enter horseless into the Stable.
10. Exit the stable, travel a ways away, and whistle for your temporary horse. Most of the time they will jump over the gates and run to you. If it doesn't come after a while, move around while continuing to call the horse.
11. Mount the horse and take it to any Stable, even the one you stole it from. Doesn't matter where.
12. Saddle up and enjoy your free horse!

### Remove Scope From Carcano and/or Rolling Block Rifles
Want a scopeless sniper in place of a Bolt Action or Springfield? In story mode, you can permanently de-scope (un-scope?) both the Rolling Block and Carcano Rifles. This glitch isn't entirely permanent, but only because you can just go to a Gunsmith and re-equip any scope to negate it. The rifle(s) will remain scopeless as long as you don't re-scope them at the Gunsmith. They will not gain the auto-aim function even if it's turned on. They still operate as the regular rifle, you're just no longer forced to scope in.

1. Hop on your horse, equip either sniper, and place it in the saddle holster.
2. Enter any Gunsmith.
3. Change the scope on the rifle. (Doesn't matter which, it just has to be changed.)
4. While still viewing in the Gunsmith menu, equip the rifle to your shoulder.
5. Exit the Gunsmith and draw the rifle you holstered earlier (LB on XB1, unsure on PS4).
6. The scopeless rifle on your back will drop. Pick it up.

### Universal Saddle Blankets
*Some Trapper saddles have unique blankets. This method does not work with two saddles which have thier own unique blankets. You can glitch the panther blanket with the Rattlesnake Vaquero Saddle but not with the Alligator Saddle.*

1. Enter a stable.
2. Equip the saddle which has the blanket you want to use.
3. Exit the stable.
4. Re-enter the stable.
5. Equip the saddle you want to use with the blanket.
6. Exit the stable.
7. Enjoy your Rattlesnake Saddle with a Panther blanket! (Or whichever combination you choose.)

### Getting the silver dapple pinto missouri fox trotter at no cost for Arthur.
1. *Save your game.*
2. Trigger the mission **Arcadia for Amateurs - III**. This does not work when replaying the mission.
3. When nearing the horses, enter **Eagle Eye** and track the Fox Trotter. Ensure you are tracking the correct horse. Sometimes its trail with be golden (like a Legendary Animal) and show up as *Unknown Animal*, but most of the time it'll show as **Herd** like the other horses.
4. Keep spamming Eagle Eye to maintain its trail. Just before you pass by Albert Mason, enter Eagle Eye one last time. This will extend the time you have to skip the cutscene before Eagle Eye cuts out.
5. Skip the cutscene immediately to end the mission as soon as possible. Eagle Eye deteriorates during the cutscene.
6. Continue Eagle Eye-ing the trail and follow it until you reach the horse. If the trail clips through the ground or becomes increasingly erratic, continue in the same direction you last saw the trail heading in. On all of my run throughs using this glitch, the Silver Dapple runs to **Elysian Pool**.
7. When you locate the horse, run alongside it and spam **Jump to Horse**. It will take some time because the horse is so jittery and you must be in perfect alignment to jump.
8. Tame the horse and bond it to **Level 1** via feeding.
9. DO NOT GET OFF OF THE HORSE. Ride it to the nearest **Stable**.
10. Stable the horse and saddle up your original horse.
11. Exit the stable, save the game, and reload.
12. Enjoy your free, wild **Silver Dapple Pinto Missouri Fox Trotter**! :)

*There are alternative methods of doing this, but they generally involve a ton of waiting, reloading, and praying to RNGsus. Yes, I'm talking about the random encounter with they lady whose horse "up and died on her". No, I don't recommend you try that over this unless you enjoy pain.*

### Saving Arthur's money for John.
The **Aberdeen Pig Farm** is inhabited by an incestual brother and sister, whom together work as a team of serial killers. There is a sort of side mission with these two: as either John or Arthur you can eat dinner with them. During which they'll offer some drinks. After drinking a few times, you pass out and wake up in their body dump site with no money. A decent backing for sticking to the story, I think, is: Arthur gets robbed, John reads about it in his journal, John goes to the farm and takes the money as it's of no use to Arthur at that point. :)

Go there and get robbed as Arthur right before the mission **"Red Dead Redemption"** (the last mission in which the player controls Arthur) but do not go back and kill them, nor get your money. Wait until you take control of John, travel to the farm, and retreive the cash from the safe behind the picture of "Mama" directly behind the front door. Kill or spare them as you see fit.

### Getting out of map. (Travel to Guarma/Mexico/Canada.)
You'll need enough alcohol to blackout to do this. If you've got the **Wolf Heart Trinket**, you'll need a lot. Now, to get compendium entries and sketches as Arthur for animals specific to New Austin (and/or Guarma before/after of Chapter 5), or just to run around and explore, you can travel out of bounds via the far west end (at the edge of a drop-off) in the **Devil's Cave**. If you're running post-Epilogue and want to explore the southern side out-of-map or travel to Guarma much quicker, an infinitely faster method is to travel to a specific point on the southern shore of the **San Luis River**.) Do the following once at either location:

1. Drink until you black out.
2. Do nondescript things while blacked out. (How the character scales seemingly sheer surfaces whilst blackout drunk is unclear. Ah, the wonders of moonshine!)
3. Wake up out of map.

**GETTING TO GUARMA:** Guarma is located at the southeast (bottom right) corner of the map. Go in that general direction until you hit the low poly (jellytown) ground. Any low-poly area is considered the physical "end of the map" which you'll fall through. If you hit a 90-degree corner, turn on it (after turning you should be facing south). Follow the seam until you begin to float (walk up an invisible hill). Turn to face the low poly section, walk a few steps over the seam and Guarma's map will render in.

- A quick side note: I black out drunk on the east side of **Aurora Basin** and woke up on the west side out-of-bounds. I will try to replicate this soon, but the few times afterwards resulted in no joy.

### Unable to save custom outfits.
Apparently this has been around for a long time and to this day goes unfixed. What happens is your saved custom outfits start glitching by starting at two, then to three, and eventually if the glitch continues you'll no longer be able to save any custom outfits. This can be bypassed by using a trainer on PC, but the only "easy" way around it is to unlock the **Legend of the East** outfit, equip and store it on your horse, then load outfits from your trainer. This basically enables all custom outfits to be suitable for all temperatures. As far as on consoles go if there is a known workaround, I don't know about it.

### Legend of the East outfit not unlocking after 90th challenge.
This is a glitch that remains unfixed. Many players have completed Bandit 10 as their final challenge and not had the outfit unlock. I, myself, have had it not unlock doing Explorer 10 as my final challenge. Always make a save before completing your final (90th) challenge, and if nothing else avoid doing Bandit 10 or Explorer 10 as your final challenge as these are problem-causers.

### Transferable discount in Saint Denis as payment for killing Jean Marc as ordered by Mayor Henri Lemieux.
This can be done with Arthur and the discount will transfer to John. However, I calculated my discount with max honor and post-story mode I'm getting only a 55% discount. According to my player menu I am getting the full 50% max honor discount. According to everyone online the discount is meant to be 10% regardless of honor. I'm unsure if I just have a glitch, if the discount is meant to have a cap at 55%, or if the discount is lowered to 5% if transferred to John rather than doing the Mayor's final mission as John.

### Duplicate journal sketches.
This is not likely a bug, but you can get journal sketches of certain things as both Arthur and John. Such as the **Cave Devil** and **Blind Man Cassidy**.

# HUNTING TIPS

### Debunking the save/reload deal.
- It works. If you're hunting rare spawns, travel to a location which is a small distance away from where the animal is known to be, save the game, and reload. Essentially, you're just refreshing all entity spawns to the area you saved the game in. This is how I managed to spot all the super rare moose spawns (like Painted Sky and along the Upper Montana). **YOU DO NOT HAVE TO EXIT THE WHOLE GAME AND RESTART FOR THE EFFECT TO WORK. THIS GOES FOR ALL SCENARIOS IN WHICH SAVING AND RELOADING IS ADVISED.**
### Use a headset if possible.
- Use a headset/headphones/earbuds when hunting. Tracking down owls by nothing but their hoots is essentially impossible with my shitty TV speakers. Hell, I even tried my old pair of Skullcandy Ink'd earbuds from 2012 and even with those I can hear everything. You don't have to use a high dollar headset... just something to isolate the game sound.
### Stealth is usually better.
- If you're roaming around looking for uncommon/rare animals, do not hunt on your horse. Go on foot, crouched, and walk slowly. Crouch running (that's what I call it) creates more noise than regular crouch walking. This difference is especially noticable when cover-scented and very close to animals. You can get within a few feet of most animals by slowly creeping up to them. Being able to get closer also opens up your options for clean kills. If stealth hunting, use the **Bow** for everything unless you're hunting down the middle ground animals which need the **Varmint Rifle** for a perfect carcass. According to my own testing, all "varmints" can be skinned for a perfect pelt when headshot with a regular arrow **EXCEPT FOR THE SKUNK AND GILA MONSTER**. Not to mention, while using the **Bow**, you won't scare off everything within a five mile radius. A number of other players claim the **Bow** is trash, but from my experience its quiet kills serve much better than its great but limited range (especially while hunting rare animals that spook easily, *ahem* Moose *cough cough*).
### Cover Scent Lotion.
- It helps immensely if you're doing some stealth hunting. Yes, you can stay downwind from the animal you're targeting. However, if you're out for anything and everything... you might spook a deer to your left, it runs towards a rabbit, which then runs towards what you're hunting for, spooks it, and they all leave you in the dust. I hardly use Eagle Eye anymore, but I also have never been bothered to check the wind direction when hunting. I kill all the beavers, skunks, and muskrats I see just for their scent glands.
### Give the game time to spawn everything.
- Stick around the area you're hunting in for a while. As in, at least a couple days. Sleeping and/or blacking out add to this, what I'm going to call, "time spent in area" mechanic. I think it's just you giving the game time to load in all the time-sensitive and random spawns. A good example: after a whole year of playing this game I've not once seen a moose at Barrow Lagoon... until I traveled to Barrow, set the game to timelapse 72 hours (via trainer), turned around, and there was the ever-so-illusive moose at Barrow, the first and only time I've ever seen it. Same goes for all animals everywhere else. That's how I killed three grizzlies west of Wallace Station within five minutes. That's also how I killed three bull meese in Tall Trees within 10 minutes. Just sleep as long as you can or blackout a couple times. Either that, or save and reload.
### Dealing with evasive/aggressive animals effectively.
- Having trouble studying aggressive and/or skittish animals? Hit them in a non-critical area with a **Poison Arrow** (regular, white hit marker). This changes their aggro and makes them flee, allowing you to study and track them as they run.
### Double your skin collection.
- If an animal can be picked up, you can get double skins from it. This is very useful when hunting animals for the **Trapper**. Kill the animal, skin it, stow both the skin and skinned carcass on your horse, ride to the trapper, and sell both the skin and the carcass. You'll also get +2 animals skinned in your Compendium since selling a carcass counts as "skinning" the animal.
### Farming wild animals.
- Most animals will decompose within 24 hours, aside from massive class animals which decompose to bones, then fully decompose. All animal carcasses from those classified as "massive" (elk, moose, bison, bears, etc) will go to bones 36 hours after being killed, then fully decompose in 72 in-game hours.
- If you're looking to farm animals for pelts, it's best to get rid of the carcass to skip the decomposition process. I've found three ways of going about this: sell the carcass as a whole (works great when doing the double skin trick), burn the carcass (with **Incendiary Buckshot**, **Fire Bottle**, or a **Fire Arrow**), or shimmy the carcass into to a body of water (even small streams work; I moved a bear into the shallow water on the southeast end of Little Creek River and it was gone after sleeping 26 hours. Alternative but slightly slower methods are: blacking out drunk and/or sleeping. To pass a huge amount of time, sleep as many times as possible and drink until you black out. If you move around a lot, I advise noting the respawn locations of and stocking up on **Aged Pirate Rum**. Only takes four to black out with the **Wolf Heart Trinket**. It's an uncommon loot item, so if you're not out for adventure, which hopefully you are, and would rather buy liquor, buy **Moonshine**. It's the highest proof liquor sold anywhere. **Kentucky Bourbon** is a close competitor but is slightly weaker than **Moonshine**.
### The best weapons.

*Here's a quick rundown:*

- The **Bow** is the best hunting weapon in practice. Yes, it's range is limited, but... one: the longest range at which you can make Bow kills is outrageous, even if you're a ways away you can close in towards the target and make the kill via deadeye still quite some distance away. Two: it can make clean kills on everything except animals which require the **Varmint Rifle** (which would have been nice to have some Varmint Arrows or just make either Regular or Small Game arrows cleanly kill the varmints). Three: you get both Poison Arrows and Dynamite Arrows.
- For rifles, here are two subclasses of **Rifles**: medium and heavy. The **Springfield** and **Bolt Action** are medium rifles. They've the same limited effective range and bullet velocity, but dominate within that range. The **Carcano** and **Rolling Block** are heavy rifles. They're more powerful than the aforementioned medium rifles and have near-hitscan bullet velocity... but two caveats: they must be scoped in (ADS) when aiming and do not allow dead eye lock-on (unlike the medium rifles). The **Bolt Action** just sacrifices a bit of damage for better accuracy, fire rate, and reload. All in all, unless you're constantly taking very long shots, the **Bolt Action** is better in practice and works for most everyone. However the **Springfield** doesn't fall far behind, and from my experience works much better in place of the **Bolt Action**. The **Carcano** surpasses the **Rolling Block** on every point except for damage. In testing (using the Entity Info feature with Rampage Trainer), the **Rolling Block** deals 4 more damage units than the **Carcano**. (Versus a Bear, the **Rolling Block** deals 74 damage while the **Carcano** deals 70 damage.) Even though the in-game stat bars show quite a bit of difference, the **Carcano** does everything the **Rolling Block** does, but with a six-round clip, slight damage reduction, and an essentially imperceptible cut in bullet velocity (as in I didn't notice it until I started looking for it during testing). Both of them will kill a moose at any reasonable distance with one shot to the head. *However*, in practice, for longer shots the **Rolling Block** comes out on top for long range sniping. And... overall in practice, an unscoped **Carcano** is the best overall hunting rifle while the **Bolt Action** is the best combat rifle. I recommend the **Rolling Block** and/or **Springfield** for those like me who don't make a lot of multi-mark deadeye kills. If you do, however, you're better off with the **Carcano** and/or **Bolt Action**.
- For revolvers, I use akimbo **LeMats**. Statistically speaking, the **Double Action** is better, but the **LeMat** is just badass to me.
- For pistols, I use akimbo **Semi Autos**. The deadeye mark-kills are crazy fast, but the **M1911** and **Mauser** do not fall far behind.

# ANIMAL LOCATIONS

### Disclaimer(s) and Information
- These are locations at which I've seen animals with my own eyes and verified they spawn there myself. Unverified/speculated locations noted from other players are in italics.
- Directions in the format such as "east-northeast" signify a biased multidirectional point. Example: "east-northeast of the ranch" means "northeast of the ranch, but more east than north.
- The "rarest" animals are listed first, then all other animals.
- When anything is in quotes, for example "Willard's Rest", it signifies the text on the overworld (pause menu) map. Actual locations are noted in bold, as such: **Willard's Rest**.
- All locations used are those which are the closest to where the animal was spotted. Some spawnpoints were a ways away from notable locations, and in those cases I've noted nearby landmarks and/or plants nearest to the spawnpoint as well as their location relative to them. I upload in-game captures for locations of animals, plants, etc on GitHub (all in a 7-Zip for convenience).

### Difficult Animals
From what I've read and my own experience, the most notoriously rare animals are, order starting at rarest:

- Western Bull Moose / Cow Moose
- Timber Wolf
- Cougar
- Grizzly Bear
- Californian Horned Owl
- Small Birds (Robin, Sparrow, Songbird, Oriole, Woodpecker, Blue Jay, etc)

### Western Bull Moose
**NOTE:** The best time for moose hunting from my experience is 14:00-18:00. I've killed more moose in that time frame than in the morning, though I've had better luck during morning runs than midday runs. Basically early morning (06:00) and shortly after noon (13:00) are the best times to head out.

**NOTE:** You don't have to stable the Perlino Andalusian nor White Arabian horses. Them being present in the wild near moose spawns doesn't seem to affect the chance of moose spawning. Nonetheless, I keep both stabled. If anything else, they take up one more space in the ped pool.

**NOTE:** All spawn locations yield a cow or bull moose of any quality at random. I've yet to obtain conclusive evidence that some spawns are exclusive to a certain gender moose. That is, of course, other than southwest of Strawberry. So far I've only come across cow moose at the two locations around the Upper Montana, and both during sleet weather.

**NOTE:** I've shot plenty of moose at night. I've also killed plenty of moose in adverse weather. Snow, rain, hell even the first bull I killed by Wallace Station was during sleet. However, I will note these few points: I generally have to wait in the area for a while before I see any. And before you jump to conclusions on the Wallace moose I killed, it was legitimate. I loaded in at Stilt Shack to sleet and was making my way down the LCR collecting wintergreen berries. I continued on down river where I almost ran past it, sleet still coming down just as strong as it was when I loaded in. Another odd one: while hunting for the moose south of the Strawberry Stable, I paced around the area where it's meant to spawn for about ten minutes. Just as the transition to sleet ended, the moose clip spawned in right as the sleet reached its full pour-down (the game's weather change mechanic spreads weather changes out over a few seconds; it popped in right as the transition ended). Coincidence? I think not. As I said, the moose clip spawned in right as the weather change to rain completed. By "clip spawn" I mean it just popped in long after I had my camera facing the spawnpoint. This might mean some moose spawns are weather-sensitive. As always, I'll continue to test this.

### Timber Wolf
**NOTE: Gray Wolves are far more common than Timber Wolves. Outside of Cotorra Springs and Cumberland Forest, every Timber Wolf I've encountered was in a team of two. I have never come across a pack of Timbers (outside of Cotorra/Cumberland) bigger than a dynamic duo. Grays are a different story... every time I get ambushed by Grays it's at least a trinamic trio.

### Cougar
**NOTE: If you're a fast draw, stealth hunting cougars may not be your best option. Because aggressive animals will rush you and your horse, sometimes it's best to just stay mounted, rifle/bow in hand, and wait for them to attack you. Especially if you don't know where they are.**

### Californian/Coastal/Great Horned Owl
**NOTE:** At 21:00, miscellaneous birds (Ravens, Crows, Sparrows, etc) no longer fly overhead. This makes it easier to spot Owls as anything flying later than 21:00 is almost guaranteed to be an Owl. The only exceptions are hawks and eagles, which only fly at night when there's a carcass/corpse nearby. But, here's a caveat I noticed: from 06:00-20:59 there seems to be way more perched (standing, stationary) Owls around pretty much everywhere I've tested (very noticable difference when rooting around in Tall Trees).

**NOTE:** Coastal and Great Horned can be found across the entire map despite name implications. (I've found Coastals all the way up at Cairn Lake.) Owls in New Austin are usually Californians, with a few Great Horned here and there, but rarely Coastals out there. I think I've killed five or six in New Austin since I got the game.

**NOTE:** Far as can tell, the Californian is exclusive to New Austin until I'm proven otherwise. Some players have noted finding it around Bear Claw (Tall Trees, WE) and the marsh flats around Canebreak Manor (Bluewater Marsh, LE).

**NOTE:** According to GTABase, the areas with the highest concentration of Owl spawns are (highest to lowest): Tall Trees, slightly north of Strawberry, the whole stretch of the Little Creek River (from Hanging Dog Ranch to Sheperd's Rise), Cumberland Falls, the Heartlands Trading Post (landmark located northwest of Gill's Landing), and Cumberland Forest (in its entirety). I can verify Tall Trees is the best for Owl hunting in general, but pre-Epilogue I've killed plenty of Great Horned and Coastals in and around Cumberland Forest while hunting Timber Wolves.

## Fish

This subsection covers all the different fish and fishing in general.

### Fishing tips.

- Contrary to what the game describes, you can catch just about every fish on any bait/lure.
- Also contrary to compendium entries, weather doesn't seem to make a damn difference.
- The **Special Spinner** attracts all species of fish and all species will bite it. Everything from bluegill to northern pike. Once acquired, it is a permanent inventory item and cannot be lost by cutting the line or to a line snap.
- The **Special Lake/River/Swamp Lures** work great if you're shooting for only big/medium fish as small fish will not bite any of the three.
- All fish have a specific pattern of nibbling/biting. Once you can recall what fish do what, you won't even need to use Eagle Eye to see what's down there.
- When using any bait, after a number of nibbles and bites your bait will completely deteriorate and you'll have to reel in and rebait. Lures are not affected by this.

Below are all fish grouped by:
- active weather
- favorite bait/lure
- bite sequence ('N' is for a nibble; 'B' is a bite)
- meat type

Arthur is a much more skilled draftsman than John. For the most part, Arthur's sketches and his wording when describing situations in journal entries are much more detailed. However there are exceptions. Sometimes, you can get both Arthur's and John's sketches of some scenarios:

- Cave Devil
- Blind Man Cassidy
- Hermit Man (at **Manito Glade**)

# EASTER EGGS

### KKK
- Encountered some guys after Epilogue II northeast of Lucky's Cabin (Heartlands, NH).

### Skinner Brothers Yelps
The sounds made by **Skinner Brothers** during ambushes and attacks are the same made by **Wapiti Tribe** members during **My Last Boy**. Likely just a borrowed scare tactic, but the **Skinner Brothers** might have some other motive in doing this. Perhaps some members are tied to the tribe and are protecting land in **Tall Trees**. Or maybe it's just the former. In either case, the jumpscare potential is unreal. Trotting along the paths, you hear screaming out of nowhere but you know what's coming.

### Voices at Colter
Spooked by those voices before? Especially up at Colter where you know damn well there's no one else around?

When returning to previous Van der Linde camps, muffled voices can be heard speaking lines mentioned prior on the story. This happens at every previous camp, not just Colter. But hearing flashback voices up there, at night, no wind, no wolf howls, in the snow is a spooky experience.
