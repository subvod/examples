# GENERAL TIPS AND TRICKS

*Some notes on general topics.*

### Weather and Attire

Dress for what's coming. Clothing "warmth" is only dependent upon temperature, but weather will affect temperature as well as visuals.

Weather | Effects/Details
:--- | ---
Clear (Sunny) | Mostly clear with a few clouds here and there.
Overcast | Solid layer of cloud cover.
Rain | Visible rain.
Thunder | Just lightning/thunder, no rain. More common in **Great Plains, WE** and **Heartlands, NH**.
Thunderstorm | Heavy rain with lightning and thunder.
Hurricane | Strong wind and heavy rain. Entire state of **Lemoyne** and **Heartlands, NH**.
Sleet | Freezing rain. Occasional gusts. Common in **Big Valley, WE**, **Heartlands, NH**, **Roanoke Ridge, NH**
Blizzard (Whiteout) | High winds. Heavy snow. Super low visibility. Northwestern portion of **Grizzlies West, AM** (high mountains).
Windy | Leaves and other animated particles flying around. Audible wind. Usually indicative of a storm ahead.
Fog | Cloud cover moves close to ground level. Very low visibility. **Heartlands, NH**, **Roanoke Ridge, NH**, **State of Lemoyne**.
Mist | Low visibility. More common in early mornings. **Heartlands, NH**, **Roanoke Ridge, NH**, **State of Lemoyne**.
Dust Storm | Strong wind. Super low visibility. All regions of **New Austin** except **Hennigan's Stead, NA**.

Temperature | Suitable<br>Warmth Points
:--- | ---
Hot<br>(>70F) | 0-2
Average<br>(50-70F) | 3
Cold<br>(<50F) | 4+

Each clothing item has its own "warmth points".

Description | Warmth Points
:--- | ---
Slightly Warm | 1
Reasonably Warm | 2
Warm | 3
Very Warm | 4

### Animal Attacks

Some animals will charge and kill you, some will randomly charge and headbutt you, some will randomly charge and bite.

Animal(s) | Attack Type
:--- | ---
Grizzly Bear<br>Wolf | Warning, charge, kill.
Cougar<br>Panther | Charge, kill.
Alligator | Warning, charge, kill.
Bighorn Ram<br>Whitetail Buck<br>Bull Elk<br>Wild Boar<br>Collared Peccary<br>Ox<br>Bull<br>Alpine Goat<br>(Domestic) Pig | Charge, headbutt.
Raccoon<br>Muskrat<br>Beaver<br>Badger<br>Skunk | Charge, bite.
All land snakes. | Flee, warning, bite.

- All land **Snakes** will bite and envenomate you. You can cure both poison (from ingesting **Oleander Sage**) and venom (from snake bites) with a **Potent** or **Special Health Cure**. Alternatively, you can eat any **Ginseng** plant.

### Bed, Bath, and Beyond

Some businesses offer lodging, baths, table games, and/or dining. If a shop as two meals available, the less costly one will fully restore all cores while the more costly one will yield a gold health core. Completing the batch "minigame" (chore) will yield a gold stamina core. All businesses where clothing can be bought offer a wardrobe somewhere inside or outside the shop.

Business | Amenities
:--- | ---
**Flatneck Station**<br>Heartlands, NH | Poker
**Keane's Saloon**<br>Valentine, Heartlands NH | Oatmeal
**Smithfield's Saloon**<br>Valentine, Heartlands, NH | Poker<br>Beef Stew<br>Lamb's Fry with green peas and boiled potatoes.
**Saints Hotel**<br>Valentine, Heartlands, NH | Room<br>Bath
**Old Light Saloon**<br>Van Horn, Roanoke Ridge, NH | Blackjack<br>Fish Stew<br>Lamb's Heart with boiled cabbage.
**Van Horn Post Station**<br>Van Horn, Roanoke Ridge, NH | Room<br>Bath
**Rhodes Parlour House**<br>Rhodes, Scarlett Meadows, LE | Blackjack<br>Cracked Wheat and Milk<br>Fried Catfish with greens and boiled beans.
**Bastille Saloon**<br>Saint Denis, Bayou Nwa, LE | Poker<br>Lobster Bisque<br>Prime Rib with potatoes dauphinoise and spring salad.
**Blackwater Saloon**<br>Blackwater, Great Plains, WE | Poker<br>Blackjack<br>Room<br>Bath<br>Peach Cobbler with cream.<br>Roast Prarie Chicken with green beans and mashed potato and gravy.
**Tumbleweed Saloon**<br>Tumbleweed, Gaptooth Ridge, NA | Poker<br>Chili<br>Roast Beef with corn and glazed carrots.
**Tumbleweed Gunsmith**<br>Tumbleweed, Gaptooth Ridge, NA | Room

### Food, Beverages, Tonics, Hair Length, and Body Weight

You can get bonuses depending on your weight. Heavier gives less damage taken, lighter gives stamina drain buff. Max is 6% gain and loss, with 0.75% increments between the two as you go between **Overweight** and **Underweight**.

Both weight and hair length is updated each time the camera fades out/in. This includes setting up camp, tearing down camp, selecting "Wait Until Morning" when at closed shops, etc.

[Source.](https://youtu.be/CmkjekIdiJo) The fastest way to gain weight is:

1. Travel to any town which serves meals.
2. Rent a room in town.
3. Go to the Saloon.
4. Eat `2` of the $5.00 meals.
5. Sleep until midnight.
6. Eat `2` more $5.00 meals at the Saloon.
7. Go to any closed shop and "Wait Until Morning".
8. Repeat.

The fastest way to grow hair is also to do the above, but drinking a hair tonic every time you spawn back in.

There is an alternative method using just free alcohol crates: just keep drinking until you black out, over and over again. [Source.](https://youtu.be/zXprkDSzKBI)

**Alcohol**

Below is a list of alcohol values per item. Coped from [this Reddit post](https://redd.it/9s6qnk/). Values amount to "proof", and are the base values before any modifiers. Higher proof means drunk quicker. A value of `1.00` is "blackout drunk". The **Wolf's Heart Trinket** halves the effects of all alcohol.

State | Range
:--- | ---
Sober | 0.00 to 0.49
Tipsy | 0.50 to 0.74
Drunk | 0.75 to 0.99
Blackout | 1.00+

Name | Value
:--- | ---
Saloon Beer | 0.1
Saloon Whiskey | 0.1
Opened Guarma Rum | 0.1
Opened Fine Brandy | 0.1
Opened Gin | 0.1
Opened Kentucky Bourbon | 0.13
Guarma Rum | 0.17
Fine Brandy | 0.17
Gin | 0.17
Kentucky Bourbon | 0.25
Moonshine | 0.3
Whiskey Bottle | 0.4
Aged Pirate Rum | 0.5

**Cores/Tonics**

In testing **Potent Tonics** against their **Special** variants, a piece of **Cooked Big Game Meat** was consumed and time was clocked when the bar was fully used up and the gold core fully depleted.

**Stamina**
1. Oregano Big Game + Special Bitters
- 01:54:04
2. Oregano Big Game + Potent Bitters
- 01:42:87

**Dead Eye**
1. Thyme Big Game + Special Snake Oil
- 0:44:21
2. Thyme Big Game + Potent Snake Oil
- 0:41:68

As you can see, **Special Bitters** makes a bit of a difference, where as **Special Snake Oil** does fairly little in terms of better fortification. Overall, if you're short on materials, bought/crafted Potent tonics will do just fine in most situations.

### Honor

Honor is measured by ranks -8 to +8 on a scale according to the total honor as an integer from -320 to +320. It affects some aspects of the game. Interaction dialog change levels are unverified, but the effect does occur.

**NOTE:** In Chapter 6, actions that affect honor have a multiplier of 1.5x. Use this to your advantage if you run low honor as Arthur but want the "high honor" ending.

Honor | Effect
:--- | ---
280 | 50% discount in all shops
240 | New outfits available in shops.
200 | 25% discount in all shops
120 | New outfits available in shops.
80 | 10% discount in all shops. Interaction dialog changes to "positive".
40 | When looting bodies, drop rates of potent tonics, restorative items, jewelry, and food is increased.
0 | When looting bodies, primarily obtain standard tonics, cheap jewelry, basic horse consumables, and used/opened alcohol and tobacco.
-40 | When looting bodies, drop rates of dead eye tonics, thrown weapons, alcohol, and tobacco are increased. Also receive more money and jewelry when looting lawmen.
-80 | Interaction dialog changes to "negative".
-280 | Ambient sounds within dead eye change.

### Transportation

*Horses are faster, so I can disappear.*

**Stagecoach/Train**

Taking a train is generally slower, depending on load time. Stagecoach is, by far, the fastest way to get somewhere. It can be costly and stage stops are few and far between, but it is by far the fastest way to get around.

Travel Method | Available Stops
:--- | ---
Stagecoach | Annesburg<br>Armadillo<br>Emerald Ranch<br>MacFarlane's Ranch<br>Rhodes<br>Saint Denis<br>Strawberry<br>Tumbleweed<br>Valentine<br>Van Horn
Campfire | Annesburg<br>Armadillo<br>Beecher's Hope<br>Benedict Point<br>Blackwater<br>Braithwaite Manor<br>Butcher Creek<br>Caliga Hall<br>Colter<br>Cornwall Kerosene & Tar<br>Emerald Ranch<br>Lagras<br>MacFarlane's Ranch<br>Manzanita Trading Post<br>Pronghorn Ranch<br>Rhodes<br>Saint Denis<br>Strawberry<br>Thieves Landing<br>Tumbleweed<br>Valentine<br>Van Horn Trading Post<br>Wapiti Indian Reservation
Train | Annesburg<br>Emerald Ranch<br>Riggs Station<br>Rhodes<br>Saint Denis<br>Valentine<br>Wallace Station

**Asking for a ride?**

You can **Callout** NPCs on wagons to ask for a ride. If accepted, you'll be taken to the nearest town.

**How many horses can I own?**

Up to four horses can be stabled, with a fifth as a "temporary" horse anywhere outside of the Stable. Temporary horses will have a horse head icon (with no bit) on the main map and minimap. Your main (saddle) horse will have the same icon but with a bit and harness. When you reach bonding level 1 with a new horse, your temporary horse will despawn automatically if it's far enough away.

**How to tame a wild horse?**

1. Hold LT when approaching to keep it from spooking immediately. While you're walking up to it, do not let its "calmness" bar deplete as that will cause it to flee. It's usually best to immediately hop on the horse when you get close enough, rather than petting it.
2. After hopping on, hold the LS in the opposite direction of where the horse is turning. If it's turning left, hold LS to the right. It's turning right, hold LS to the left. The backwards and forwards movements aren't needed, just left to right.

*Alternative methods:*

- Hit it in a non-vital spot with any gun, then revive it. This carries more risk, but immediately grants bonding rank 1.
- Lasso it. This is the quick and dirty method, but it works. Stay on your own horse, ride up to the wild one, lasso it, and move forwards to hop on.

**How to max bond horses fast?**

- Food items have their own unique bonding point yields. Peppermints give the most points (6), while Sugar Cubes give (5).
- Completing two horse races with at least one of the [associated Horse Racer NPCs](#horse-races) will both allow you to bond with your horse while spurring and (after winning the second race) gives a third bar of speed for your saddled horse. Traveling in cinematic mode gives bonding points after completing the second race; a great legitimate way to bond AFK.
- Leading your horse yields more bonding points per minute than anything else. Yes, even more than constantly shoving Peppermints down your new horse's throat. The old rubber band trick works for this. CheatEngine64's speedhack also works wonders if you're rushing or just short on time.

1. Begin leading your horse.
2. Travel to the open fields of **The Heartlands**. Alternatively you can go to the plains west of Blackwater, but there are more snakes out that way. (Getting close to any aggressive animal will end the lead.)
3. Wrap a rubber band around your thumbstick and the end of either palm grip (depending on the length of the rubber band).
4. Do other things for a while. (About 20 minutes.)
5. Come back to your fully bonded horse.

- *BY DOING THIS, YOU'RE BASICALLY STILL IN-GAME, SO THE POSSIBILITY OF HOSTILITY FROM BOUNTY HUNTERS, BUSHWHACKERS, ROBBERS, AGGRESSIVE ANIMALS, ETC IS STILL PRESENT. MIGHT WANT TO PEEK AT THE SCREEN EVERY NOW AND THEN AND/OR KEEP AN EAR OUT.*
- *If on the PC version without a controller, you can use [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to simulate holding down the movement key(s).*

**What is the best horse?**

A purely subjective question. But, statistically speaking and taking into account my own experience in practice, the **Turkoman** and **Missouri Fox Trotter** are the best all-around breeds. Sure they don't have as fantastic of stats as Arabians, but those Arabians dart off at the first clink of a pen drop. The Turkoman and MFT are both well-rounded breeds, however they can only be obtained from Stables and some are locked until a certain story progression point.

For the "best" horse that can be found in the wild, I've found the **Thoroughbred** and **American Standardbred** breeds are the best balanced and closest to Turkoman and MFT.

Again, all purely subjective. Some players may go for looks. Others may go for stats. Like a certain coat on a certain horse, but don't care for its stats? If you're on PC, you're in luck:

**What's the best saddle?**

Technically, the **Beaver Roping Saddle** is the "best" saddle solely in terms of game logic because it provides the highest **Stamina Regen** (same as **Panther** and **Rattlesnake** saddles) and **Health Core Drain** bonuses. My reasoning behind this is: horse health core drain intensifies when they're dirty. I don't brush my horse often, so a lot of times it's just dirty. That being the case, the occasional health core penalty is lowered that much more with the Beaver Saddle. If you often push your horse hard and brush it once in a while, the **Panther Trail Saddle** is more fit for you. All that said, even though the aforementioned are the "best" stat-wise, I occasionally use the **Alligator Ranch Cutter** or **Cougar McClelland** saddles on my **Sooty Buckskin Dutch Warmblood** just because they look better on it. The stats don't differ a ton between higher-end **Trapper** saddles, so I generally just match the saddle to the horse I'm using. **Panther Trail** looks damn good to me on an **Amber Champagne MFT**.

**Auto Travel**

Aside from fast travel (unlocked by purchasing the map from the camp ledger), you can autopilot to a destination: set a destination (must be in a road/path) on the map, hop on your horse and begin sprinting towards the waypoint. While sprinting, hold down the SELECT button (XB1) or X button (on PS4) to enter cinematic view. Black bars will appear and you will travel to the waypoint.

**NOTE:** I've observed that sometimes, regardless of distance, when I arrive at the waypoint my horse will have a full stamina core and bar. I've seen this only when doing so with a level 4 bonded horse (and feeding it a **Horse Meal** and injecting a **Potent Horse Stimulant** before going into Cinematic Camera). Every time I've done this with a non-max-level bonded horse, it always ends up with an empty stamina core and bar regardless of what I feed/inject it with.

**NOTE:** events still occur, it's just a different camera view. You can still get attacked by a predator or enemies.

### Weapons

**Weapon Familiarity**

Yes, it's a thing and if you'd never seen it on the Compendium for each weapon you'd never know of it. Familiarity affects all stats, and the more familiar you are with a weapon, the better shot you become with it.

- Use dead eye to get headshots.
- If avoiding law and bounties, enemy hideouts refresh every few in-game days. The numerous Del Lobo hideouts in New Austin become accessible after Chapter 6.

**What is the best weapon?**

In practice, the **Bow** is the best hunting weapon for three reasons:

1. Yes, its range is limited and does not yield perfect varmint pelts, but the longest range at which you can make Bow kills is outrageous. Even if you're a ways away you can close in towards the target and make the kill via deadeye still quite some distance away. Granted, though it may be slim, there is still a chance to miss even with deadeye lock-on when the target is near the outside edge of the bow's maximum range.
2. It can make clean kills on everything except most animals which require the **Varmint Rifle** (which would have been nice to have some Varmint Arrows or just make either Regular or Small Game arrows cleanly kill the varmints). Most varmint kills with regular arrows will almost always yield a one-less-star pelt, i.e. you kill a three star and it will almost always drop to two stars. Be that as it may, there are exceptions to this: a headshot with a poison arrow to beavers and iguanas almost always yields a perfect pelt for me when skinning the two-star carcass. But every other varmint (skunks, possums, etc) rarely gives a perfect pelt with any arrow kill.
3. You get to craft and use **Poison/Fire/Dynamite Arrows**.

- Scoped rifles are more powerful than medium rifles and have near-hitscan bullet velocity, but two caveats: they must be scoped in when aiming (unless the de-scope glitch is used) and do not allow dead eye lock-on (even if de-scoped via glitch). The **Carcano** surpasses the **Rolling Block** on every point. It does everything the **Rolling Block** does, but with a six-round clip. Both of them will one-shot-headshot-kill a bear at any reasonable distance. Overall in practice, an unscoped **Carcano** is the best heavy rifle. It must be noted as well that a **Carcano** with **Express Ammo** deals more damage per shot than a **Rolling Block** with **Express Ammo**.
- The medium rifles, the **Bolt Action** sacrifices just a bit of damage for better accuracy, fire rate, and reload. All in all, unless you're constantly taking very long shots, the **Bolt Action** is better in practice and works for most everyone. The **Springfield's** slightly higher damage is not a proportional tradeoff to the loss of accuracy and single-round capacity.
- For revolvers, the **LeMat** comes out on top in terms of damage. The  **Double Action** has the best DPS (damage per second), but the **LeMat** also offers a secondary shotgun barrel. Slow to reload both the cap and ball ammo as well as the center grapeshot barrel, but you get everything in one package. The shotgun barrel itself appears to have quite less effective range than a **Sawed Off Shotgun**, but it's still mad effective at close range as a shotgun is meant to be.
- For pistols, **Mauser** is the best all-around. Yes, the **M1899** has better damage and accuracy. Yes, the **Semi Auto** slightly higher fire rate allows it to make stupid fast deadeye kills. The **Mauser** reigns because it gets the extra two rounds per clip (10 total; where as the **Semi Auto** and **M1899**) and nearly matches the **Semi Auto Pistol** rate of fire. It's essentially the middle ground, best of both worlds.

Below is a damage chart organized by weapon and bullet type (ordered corresponding to what's in-game). Weapon rows are grouped by class, with the highest damage of its class being at the top and all others in descending order. Incendiary and explosive ammo was not tested because... well, you know. Shotguns weren't tested either because... you get the gist. Testing was done with five shots of each bullet type for all weapons to eliminate one-off cases. All shots were to a grizzly's rear upper thigh (outside any critical/fatal areas). Damage was measured via RampageTrainer's in-game NPC debug feature.

Split point rounds deal slightly more damage at close range than high velocity rounds. I've yet to test them at longer ranges, though I imagine it'll be no different from a distance. Weapon familiarity does not affect damage. I've not tested shotguns yet. All unique weapons are identical to their regular counterparts (in terms of damage) except for those listed below.

### Map Icons

- I used [this map](https://gtaforums.com/topic/968364-complete-map-with-all-discoverable-icons/) as a reference.
- Icons are rough areas of static spawns. There usually isn't a spawn of the marked animal directly at the icon's location, just in the general area.
- Animal drawings are added to the map when an animal is focused on, studied, picked up, or skinned in a specific area. The best thing to do is study and track everything you come across. Binoculars are by far the best way to add icons.
- Plant drawings are added when a plant is picked at least once in the immediate area of the icon. Best to pick everything you come across because spawning a plant with a trainer and picking it does not add the icon for some reason (unlike skinning/tracking animals).
- Point of interest and collectibel locations are added when they are "investigated".
- All map icons do not change based on what character discovered them. The journal sketches do, though.

**Pearson's Rabbit**

Available from Chapter II to Chapter VI. Pearson will be drinking beer at his wagon's table. When you walk near him, it will only give a **Greet** prompt when the request is available for activation (like every other request). There are two cheese methods to get it to pop; rinse and repeat as needed:

- Low or zero health core. Sleep until morning, then drink a bunch of **Whiskey/Moonshine** or eat **Oleander Sage**. Head out of camp until around 10:00, then head back in.
- Wait until just after 10:00, then suicide jump off the cliff to the west right out of camp. After respawning, head back into camp.

**Dutch's Pipe**

I've gotten it to pop right after starting both Chapters II and III. In those, Dutch will be standing on the front right side of his tent. In Chapter IV, he'll be standing outside the south door of **Shady Belle**.

# HUNTING TIPS

### Debunking the save/reload deal.

**YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FULLY EXIT AND RESTART THE WHOLE GAME FOR THE "REFRESH" TO WORK. THIS GOES FOR ALL SCENARIOS IN WHICH SAVING AND RELOADING IS ADVISED, INCLUDING RANDOM ENCOUNTERS WITH NPCs.**

Been looking for some rare animal for hours? If you're hunting anything and it doesn't show up soon after you get to its known location:

1. If you know its exact spawn location, travel to it.
2. Set up camp on the spot.
3. Sleep until the best time frame for the animal, if known.
4. Tear down the camp.
5. Save and reload.
6. Once reloaded in, if it doesn't spawn around immediately, just travel a few hundred paces away and head back.

By sleeping, you're advancing time a bit to refresh any time-sensitive spawns. Usually it's best to sleep for a full 72 hours, but since I cannot find any direct evidence that any time-sensitive spawn mechanic is present I just sleep until the desired time frame. Might just be superstition on my part, but I seem to have better luck all the time after sleeping.

By saving and reloading, you're refreshing all entity spawns in the area you saved in. This is how I manage to spot all the super rare moose spawns (like **Painted Sky** and along the **Upper Montana River**).

### Use a headset if possible.

- Use a headset/headphones/earbuds when hunting. Tracking down owls by nothing but their hoots is essentially impossible with my shitty TV speakers. Hell, I even tried my old pair of Skullcandy Ink'd earbuds from 2012 and even with those I can hear everything. You don't have to use a high dollar headset... just something to isolate the game sound.

### Stealth is usually better.

If you're roaming around looking for uncommon/rare animals, do not hunt on your horse. Go on foot, crouched, and walk slowly. Crouch running (that's what I call it) creates more noise than regular crouch walking, but not nearly as much as sprinting. This difference is especially noticable when cover-scented and very close to animals. You can get within a few feet of most animals by slowly creeping up to them. Being able to get closer also opens up your options for clean kills. If stealth hunting, use the **Bow** for everything unless you're hunting down the middle ground animals which need the **Varmint Rifle** for a perfect carcass. Not to mention, while using the **Bow**, you won't scare off everything within a five mile radius. A number of other players claim the **Bow** is trash, but from my experience its quiet kills serve much better than its great but limited range (especially while hunting rare animals that spook easily, *ahem* Moose *cough cough*). The only time I recommend fast-paced hunting is when you know where the animal is or if you've an insane reaction time (primarily relating to hunting cougars/panthers).

### Cover Scent Lotion

It helps immensely if you're doing some stealth hunting. The crafting recipie is unlocked upon starting **Chapter 2**. You cook down the **Scent Glands** from **Skunks**, **Beavers**, and **Muskrats**. You to get way closer to animals without drawing their attention. Yes, you can stay downwind from the animal you're targeting. However, if you're out for anything and everything... you might spook a deer to your left, it runs towards a rabbit, which then runs towards what you're hunting for, spooks it, and they all leave you in the dust.

### Give the game time to spawn everything.

Stick around the area you're hunting in for a while. As in, at least a couple days. Sleeping and/or blacking out add to this, what I'm going to call, "time spent in area" mechanic. I think it's just you giving the game time to load in all the time-sensitive and random spawns. A good example: after a whole year of playing this game I've not once seen a moose at Barrow Lagoon... until I traveled to Barrow, set the game to timelapse 72 hours (via trainer), turned around, and there was the ever-so-illusive moose at Barrow, the first and only time I've ever seen it. Same goes for all animals everywhere else. That's how I killed three grizzlies west of Wallace Station within five minutes. That's also how I killed three bull meese in Tall Trees within 10 minutes. Just sleep as long as you can or blackout a couple times. Either that, or save and reload.

Looking away from a known spawn of any animal will usually let it spawn in. Here's a great example of this with the [bull moose up at Colter](https://youtu.be/JAZfloo_5GA). And another example of the [bull moose at Lake Isabella](https://youtu.be/L4Ve1vLbIWU).

### Studying evasive/aggressive animals effectively.

Having trouble studying aggressive and/or skittish animals? Hit them in a non-critical area with a **Poison Arrow** or **Poison Throwing Knife**. This changes their aggro and makes them flee, allowing you to study and track them as they run. Alternatively you can try to land a critical hit, but I've yet to find any gun which can land crits consistently.

### Collecting animals which land in deep water.

Hunting loons, seagulls, or water snakes? Use a boat. Any boat will do. One edge of the boat needs to be quite close to the carcass you're meaning to collect, so it can take some getting used to. Most boats in the game, even the short wooden pirogues are high enough that the pickup animation will clip.

### Farming gritty fish meat for potent predator bait.

Method 1:

1. Set up camp just west of **Prinz & Co**.
2. Fish on the banks for **Longnose Gar**.
3. After catching one, walk to your already-set-up camp nearby and select the "Cook" option.
4. Your screen will go black and you'll reappear at the fire cooking the first piece of fish.
5. Store or eat the first cooked piece
6. Back out of the cooking menu
7. Leave the campfire.
8. Rinse and repeat.

Method 2:

1. Go to **Lagras**.
2. Fish off of the docks around the settlement.
3. You'll be feeling for **Bullhead Catfish**, **Bluegill**, **Channel Catfish**, and **Longnose Gar**. Neither **Rock Bass** nor **Perch** spawn around **Lagras**, so you've not to worry about snagging one of those bastards. On the flip side, you may get **Smallmouth/Largemouth Bass**, **Chain Pickerel**, and/or **Lake Sturgeon**, but all their bite sequences are different from what you want. See [Weather, Baits, and Bite Sequences](#weather-baits-and-bite-sequences) for details.

### Farming wild animals.

Most animals will decompose within 24 hours, aside from massive class animals which decompose to bones, then fully decompose. All animal carcasses from those classified as "massive" (elk, moose, bison, bears, etc) will go to bones 36 hours after being killed, then fully decompose in 72 in-game hours.

If you're looking to farm animals for pelts, it's best to get rid of the carcass completely to skip the decomposition process. I've found three ways of going about this:

1. Sell the carcass whole to the **Trapper** or a **Butcher**.
2. Shimmy the carcass into to a body of water deep enough for the carcass to float. This works when you don't want to lug around a carcass you don't want to haul and sell.
3. Burn the carcass. I've had super spotty success with this, which is why I advise more to use the first two methods. Sometimes burning the carcass still leaves bones, where as donating/selling the carcass completely gets rid of it for sure and leaving it floating in even semi-deep water does the job more consistently.

You can attract scavenger birds and mammals by leaving a freshly killed carcass out in the open, then watching it from afar. Most areas will spawn rats, vultures, hawks, eagles, etc, over the carcass.

### How to get perfect skins, pelts, hides, etc.

**NOTE:** If you're on PC, there are tons of [Mods](#mods) available which alter pelt cleanliness, gun damage, etc.

According to my own testing, all "varmints" can be skinned for a perfect pelt when headshot with a regular arrow except for the **Skunk** and **Gila Monster**. You're still chancing it not being perfect, though. Same goes for killing small birds (robins, woodpeckers, etc) and animals (rats, frogs, etc) with the **Varmint Rifle**. The **Varmint Rifle** itself is interesting, though. You get a huge range buff for trading off pelt damage. From my experience it seems like every fourth or fifth kill ends up perfect, so about a 20-25% chance of keeping the "perfect" quality of a small bird/animal. After completing story mode and free roaming in Epilogue, I highly recommend switching to the **Varmint Rifle** when hunting birds. Small animals like frogs and even flightless birds like Quail are quite easy to hit with a **Small Game Arrow**. But going after some Pigeons or Woodpeckers in-flight with a Bow and Small Game Arrows has always driven me mad because the arrows can only hit below a certain aim angle and are also limited by range. The Varmint Rifle's low chance of perfect carcasses is worth the range tradeoff if you know what you're looking for and where to find a lot of them.

# FISHING TIPS

- Contrary to compendium entries, weather doesn't seem to make a damn difference in spawn/bite rates.
- Certain fish are more attracted to certain lures/baits, but quick-pressing RT will attract all fish to your lure/bait. Be that as mit may, some may not necessarily nibble/bite it. Flicking RT more than once while fish are near the bait/lure will scare them off.
- The regular **Swamp/River/Lake Lures** are consumable.
- The **Special Swamp/River/Lake Lures** are a permanent inventory item and cannot be lost by any means, including line snaps.
- **Cheese/Bread/Corn/Worm/Cricket/Crayfish** baits can be lost in two ways: either line snaps or an extensive number of bites.
- If you dislike clutter and don't plan on using other types of baits/lures (worms, crayfish, crickets, regular lures), do not buy a whole lot of them as you have to manually lose them. There is no "Discard" option in the satchel for these. The fastest way to get rid of unwanted baits is to cause a line snap. To do this: hook any medium or large fish, then as soon as it's hooked pull and keep LS down while reeling in. Attach another unwanted bait/lure and repeat. Irritating, innit?
- Small fish will not even nibble on lures of any type except for the **Special Spinner**. They will only hit on consumable baits.
- The **Special Spinner** attracts all species of fish and all species will bite it. Everything from bluegill to northern pike. Once acquired, it is a permanent inventory item and cannot be lost due to cutting or snapping the line.
- **Special Lures** count as their regular counterparts in the **Compendium** Fish entries. As in, you can catch a **Channel Catfish** with either a **Regular** or **Special Swamp Lure** as both count towards 100% for that species.
- Push LS down to lower your rod. Keep it down while reeling when awaiting a bite. When you get a bite, pull LS back. This both sets the hook and pulls the fish in at the same time, giving you a head start right off the bat.
- Continue using LS up and down to pull the fish in faster, unless you're a glutton for punishment. Reeling in fish like the **Legendary Muskie** are a bitch if you don't know about using LS to make faster progress. I learned the hard way, you needn't.
- All fish have a specific pattern of nibbling/biting. Once you can recall what fish do what, you won't even need to use Eagle Eye to see what's down there.
- There is no direct way to break down large fish like Pike or Gar. See [Break Down Large Fish](#break-down-large-fish) for the hacky method.

# RANDOM EVENTS

### Horse Races

There are three NPCs which will challenge you to a horse race, each with two of their own unique destinations. Winning the first race will allow you to bond with your horse while spurring it. Winning a second will add another mark of speed to whatever horse you have saddled (your main horse).

I have raced the man in Big Valley with a level 2 bonded horse before, so your horse doesn't need to be fully bonded to level 4.

These locations were taken from [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/QU1fd4OPDuo) and verified manually. Below is a quoted comment on the same video from [this user](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdPexLQVoanuYMfe3V6p_jw).

> For The People Who Can’t Get These Races To Spawn<br><br>I have done my research on this by looking into the source code with the stranger and how often the races will spawn so basically as I was looking through the source I found that as Arthur the stats and spawn percentage depending on your chapter is different and this will be a full in depth guide at what I found<br><br>Chapter 1-No Horse Races Spawn For Arthur (because of colter and the game doesn’t expect you down there)<br>Chapter 2- Arthur Has 7 chances of declining during this chapter and the horse spawn rates are (90%)<br>Chapter 3-Arthur has 5 chances of declining and the spawn rates are (79%)<br>Chapter 4-Arthur has 5 chances of declining and spawn rates are (60%)<br>Chapter 5-No Horse Races Spawn For Arthur (because of Guarma)<br>Chapter 6- Arthur has 4 chances of declining and spawn rates are (45%)<br>Epilogue 1-John has 3 chances at declining and spawn rates are (25%)<br>Epilogue 2-John has 3 chances at declining and spawn rates are (10%)<br><br>Now oddly when you beat the game the spawn rate drops to a 2% spawn rate and John for some reason only gets 2 chances to race but it seems with each chapter the world becomes more rainier and spawn rates drop and the world feels more boring and they actually cut a lot of the base chapter encounters from the epilogue so in my opinion if your in the epilogue don’t try this because I got curious the other day and started wandering around in the epilogue and realized the racers weren’t spawning so I got curious and wanted to check for ya’ll and this is probably not worth the attempt if you beat the game and are playing as John

Selling animals not local to the area you sell them in gives a small bonus in sell price. The general rule of thumb is the farther away from the animal's habitat, the more it will sell for. Go figure. Cross-country hauling one moose pelt to the Tumbleweed Butcher just for an extra $2.00-3.00*

### Orchids

- **Orchids** are flowering plants which can be found sporadically around the entire map aside from **Great Plains, WE** and all of **New Austin** (aside from a single **Sparrow's Egg Orchid** in **Rio Bravo, NA**).
- After completing `Dutchesses and Other Animals`, you can collect the `Rare Orchids Order` from the board at any **Post Office** (Rhodes or Valentine). This allows **Orchids** and **Heron/Egret/Spoonbill Plumes** to be mailed to **Algernon Wasp** for cash. The payment mailed back will only be for a single orchid, so sending a stack of 7 of the same orchid will not affect the mailed payment. That being the case, to maximize profit: send one orchid, allow 6 hours to pass (sleep, blackout drunk, or wait until morning at a shop), collect the payment, and repeat.
- A lone **Sparrow's Egg Orchid** can be found directly north of the **Legendary Pronghorn**.

**WARNING:** AFTER COMPLETING ALL STAGES OF `Dutchesses and Other Animals`, DO NOT SEND MORE THAN ONE ORCHID SPECIES AT A TIME. DOING SO WILL GLITCH OUT THE ORCHID MAILING ORDER. [More info here.](#unable-to-send-orchids-by-mail)

Price | Orchid(s)
:--- | ---
$15.00 | Dragon's Mouth
$14.00 | Night Scented<br>Moccasin Flower<br>Ghost<br>Clamshell
$11.00 | Sparrow's Egg<br>Lady of the Night<br>Cigar<br>Acuna's Star
$10.00 | Rat Tail<br>Queen's<br>Lady Slipper<br>

# BUGS

*These are bugs which don't appear to have exploitable benefits.*

### Facial hair glitch

Sometimes the player's facial hair will appear to grow beside the eyes, high on the sides of the jaw, and patches on the lower neck. The only way to fix this is to exit and restart the game.

### Cattleman Hero Grip wrong texture

There's a bug with the hero grip on Cattleman Revolvers where the grip will retain the gold details but revert to a wooden base. The only known way to prevent this from happening is to not purchase any other grip or varnish. The only known way to fix it is to reset to the default (or pearl) grip, then set it back to the hero grip.

### Unable to obtain Wild Man's Journal

If you're facing a wonky direction just right while picking up the **Wild Man's Journal**, it is possible to clip out of the animation and forever prevent you from obtaining it. Do yourselves a favor and make a save before pursuing him back to his cave just in case you stumble into some stupid clipping action like I did.

### Bugged soldier during The King's Son

I've had this happen numerous times. There's an enemy army soldier standing dead still on the south side of the incomplete house (just the frame of a house). You must kill him **AFTER** killing all other enemies registered before the next mission checkpoint. I found it always works if you leave him for last, then knife from behind. Doing so has allowed me to proceed onto the main Cornwall building without having the mission dialog show up as if I'm leaving the gang behind.

### Unable to send orchids by mail

After taking the **Rare Orchids Order**, you are forced to send all you have of one orchid at a time. This does not affect payout via mail. Beware, though, as sending more than one species of orchid at a time will glitch out the mailing order and you will no longer be able to send more orchids nor receive money for orchids sent. For example, sending both a **Dragon's Mouth Orchid** and **Acuna's Star Orchid** will glitch out the mailing order. Always send only one orchid species and receive its payment **one at a time** to avoid glitching it.

### Second horse disappears while camping

[Source.](https://gtaforums.com/topic/917511-things-you-didnt-know-about-rdr2-until-now/?do=findComment&comment=1071884440)

If you load your game while camped at your campsite, your secondary horse will disappear, saving and reloading your game while not at the campsite will bring it back.

### Severe flickering or outright blackout in Bluewater Marsh and/or Bayou Nwa

I've found this to occur only when I'm near a **Snowy Egret** or the ghost of **Agnes Dowd**. No clue why, as it has never happened anywhere else. Likely just specific to my system and/or graphics settings.

### Javier not getting off his horse during Chez Porter Homestead Robbery

Present on both Xbox One and PC. Basically, you start the robbery, travel to **Chez Porter** with Javier, but when the black bars retract and Javier advises to go on foot from there, he won't get off his horse. The quickest way to fix this is suicide, but you can also run off to abandon Javier (thus failing the mission). Either way, restarting from checkpoint afterwards he should spawn off his horse and you can continue the mission normally.

### Locations not being noted on the map

I know of several locations which have buggy overworld map names:

- Dormin Crest, Grizzlies West, AM
- Planter's Baun, Grizzlies West, AM
- Nekoti Rock, Tall Trees, WE
- Rattlesnake Hollow, Cholla Springs, NA

These can be obtained, they're just dodgy as shit. Save your game quite a ways away from each before entering them for the first time. Just keep rolling the dice until the name shows up, move onto the next, save again, enter the next, etc, etc. The only location I've never been able to obtain is Granger's Hoggery. I've no idea why. There are other cabins and such which don't appear to have overworld map names, but those are completely void as they don't have a name to begin with.

For **Dormin Crest**, you must enter the cabin while the random encounter is still active. (Where there's a trail coming out of the front door.) I noticed in `PC v1436` the front door jots aside just a tiny bit just before reaching to open it. This only happens when the event is active. Still, I had to keep reloading and retrying to get it to show up on the map.

For **Planter's Baun**, I did not explore Grizzlies West extensively as long as I could. Barrow Lagoon and the surrounding area remained with fog of war. In Chapter 3, even though I hadn't explored up there and the fog of war was still there, the name showed up on the map shortly after starting Chapter 3. Yes, on top of the fog of war. I've no idea why or how. The door of the cabin itself isn't have the same forward jot like **Dormin Crest**, so on every run I've done it's been hit or miss.

For **Nekoti Rock** and **Rattlesnake Hollow**, there appear to be very small, specific areas you have to visit to get the names to pop. Nothing glitchy to them. I've not narrowed down exactly where aside from inside the cave with the chest (at Rattlesnake) and atop the highest peaks just aside OOB (at Nekoti).

### Discount at Saint Denis shops as reward for killing Jean Marc as ordered by Mayor Henri Lemieux

This can be done with Arthur and the discount will transfer to John. However, I calculated my discount with max honor and post-story mode I'm getting only a 55% discount. According to my player menu I am getting the full 50% max honor discount. According to everyone online the discount is meant to be 10% regardless of honor. I'm unsure if I just have a glitch, if the total discount at shops is meant to have be capped at 55%, or if the discount is lowered to 5% if transferred to John rather than doing the Mayor's final mission as John and (possibly) getting the full 10%. Regardless, 5% is better than nothing.

### Unable to save custom outfits

Apparently this has been around for a long time and to this day goes unfixed. What happens is your saved custom outfits start glitching by starting at two, then to three, and eventually if the glitch continues you'll no longer be able to save any custom outfits. This can be bypassed by using a trainer on PC, but the only "easy" way around it is to unlock the **Legend of the East** outfit, equip and store it on your horse, then load outfits from your trainer. As far as consoles go, if there is a known workaround I haven't been made aware of it.

### Legend of the East outfit not unlocking after 90th challenge

This is a glitch that remains unfixed. Many players have completed Bandit 10 as their final challenge and not had the outfit unlock. I, myself, have had it not unlock doing Explorer 10 as my final challenge. Always make a save before completing your final (90th) challenge, and if nothing else avoid doing Bandit 10 or Explorer 10 as your final challenge as these are problem-causers. If there is no turning back (like the position I was in, saving after completing the last challenge):

1. Open the settings menu and press [Y] (on Xbox controller) to open the cheat menu.
2. Enter the cheat "Vanity. All is vanity"
3. Close the settings menu.
4. Open a Trainer; I use Rampage.
5. Enable the cheat bypass function.
6. Go back to the Settings menu, enable the cheat you entered (unlock all outfits)
7. Go back in game and equip the **Legend of the East** outfit at camp.
8. Save your game.

### Micro-Stuttering, FPS Drops, ERR_GFX_STATE Popup/Crash, and other graphics issues

For micro-stuttering (I had it about once every ten seconds):

- Restart your computer. Yes, I know, stereotypical. But it generally works even for me.
- Change your graphics API. If you're using Vulkan, change to DX12. If the contrary, do the opposite. See which works better. Some users Note Vulkan runs a bit faster but DX12 looks crisper/sharper.
- Update/reinstall your graphics driver. Yeah, again, cliche... but the shit worked for me. Be sure to do a **CLEAN INSTALL** when reinstalling/updating the driver. It fixed the micro-stuttering I was encountering (about once every ten seconds). System info: ASUS G14 (2021) AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS @ 3301 MHz, 16384MB, NVIDIA RTX 3060 Laptop GPU, RDR2 Build 1436, NVIDIA Driver v471.96
- Periodically delete everything in the Settings folder except for "system.xml" (to retain graphics settings). Some sources claim that deleting the `.bin` files isn't necessary, but I do it anyway and it works. Doing this can also fix crashing because of `ERR_GFX_STATE`. [[Reference.]](https://www.reddit.com/r/RDR2/comments/dxlreb/err_gfx_state/)

The last step can be semi-automated using [BleachBit](https://github.com/bleachbit/bleachbit). (I began using it when Avast decided to fuck up CCleaner.) All you have to do is `BleachBit > Preferences > Custom > Add Folder` and add your RDR2 `Settings` folder. Then, `BleachBit > Preferences > Whitelist` and add your `system.xml` file to prevent BleachBit from deleting it (retaining your GFX settings).

# GLITCHES

*These are bugs/glitches which can be exploited.*

### Going to New Austin as Arthur

[In-mission method](https://youtu.be/1FUCZLHJSGk) during `Who is Not Without Sin`.

### Keep Arthur's unique suit from The Gilded Cage

[Source.](https://youtu.be/nrecu-MKn-c)

1. Continue mission normally until you get to the part where Arthur, Dutch, Hosea, and Bill are walking towards the house's front door.
2. U-turn and fail mission by leaving the area.
3. Cancel the mission when the "Mission Fail" prompt comes up.
4. You should've respawned with the suit equipped. If not, it evidently may take a few tries.
5. Go to any Wardrobe.
6. Change one item on the outfit.
7. Save the outfit with the custom item equipped.

### Keep Arthur's closed Winter Shogun Coat

*The coat can be applied with any trainer, but here's how to keep it without one.*

1. Right after entering Chapter 2 at Horseshoe Overlook, go to your horse and equip the "Custom Outfit" stored on it.
2. Go to your wardrobe and save the outfit.

### Looting saddle bags and not getting the shit kicked out of you.

*This glitch allows you to search both saddle bags of any horse without getting kicked in the face.*

1. Hop on the horse you want to loot.
2. Ride/lead the horse right next to any solid, static object that will partially block you phsically digging through the saddle bag, be it a tree, rock/boulder, wagon, train, etc. Ensure after you hop off that the **Search Saddle Bag** prompt is still there. A good point of reference (for me) is the edge of the object must be just behind the saddle bag.
3. Search the saddle bag. When done right, the game will not allow the animation to complete because you'd clip too far into the horse. This works in much the same way as evading the full animal skinning animation.
4. Enjoy your saddle bag loot never having to get kicked in the face ever again.

### Break down large fish.

For whatever reason, there is no prompt to break down large fish from the satchel inventory menu. So, that being the case, here's how:

1. Stow the large fish on your main horse.
2. Set up camp.
3. Stand up, retrieve the fish from your horse, and carry it to your campfire.
4. Select the "Cook" option.
5. Store the first cooked piece of fish meat in your satchel. Do not cook more than one piece as that would be counterintuitive.
6. Exit the cooking menu. All large fish yield 4-6 pieces of their associated meat.
7. This method also adds the carcass itself to your horse's inventory, but it will not show up physically and doesn't take up the "large" stow spot on your horse. You can do as you wish with the stowed fish carcass. Sell it to butcher/trapper, donate to camp, discard, etc.

### Keep temporary documents.

[Video of using the glitch](https://youtu.be/jZXI3JYEqv8) by [Alcomahol](https://gtaforums.com/profile/1162284-alcomahol/).

You can obtain almost every temporary document using this glitch. "Almost" because some documents cannot be stored permanently even with this glitch.

1. Inspect/open the document.
2. Pause the game, enter photo mode, and quickly exit. This enables all document controls for a very, very brief period of time. Including the ability to store it. On PC, you can spam F6 and Enter.

### Launch from horse with carcass stowed on side.

This might not be very useful, but I found that with a Condor stored on the side of a horse, getting off on the same side launches me up about 10 feet before landing. I've been able to launch atop buildings you normally wouldn't be able to access doing this.

### Getting caught when quickly dismounting your horse.

While wearing chaps/spats, I found that occasionally I'll fumble off my horse when dismounting while the horse is still running.

### Steal any horse from any stable.

[Source.](https://youtu.be/F2J00n9a7-s)

*This works with all horses at every Stable. You must be able to buy the horse after it's unlocked. (Unlocking it puts the horse physically in the stable to be bought. For example, you can't steal an Amber Champagne MFT from Scarlett Meadows before Chapter 4.) Stealing horses in this manner doesn't reduce honor. Some Stables are easier to hit than others, though.*

1. Get any wagon or buggy. Larger ones are preferable.
2. Ride the wagon to the Stable which houses the horse you want to steal.
3. Put on a mask/bandana.
4. As you enter the Stable, pull out any gun, aim, and fire just as the horse enters the doors of the stable. Doing this prevents the Stable doors from closing.
5. Ensure you've at least one witness. It's necessary for this method.
6. Park the wagon between the Stable doors. (Again, to ensure they don't close.)
7. Hop off the wagon and go to the horse you want to steal.
8. You won't be able to mount the horse, so feed it using the **Horse Menu** until it registers as a **Temporary Horse**.
9. Hide until the witnesses/law stop searching. You can mount the horse just before the search ends to auto-enter the stable. If not, the black bars will appear and you'll enter horseless into the Stable.
10. Exit the stable, travel a ways away, and whistle for your temporary horse. Most of the time they will jump over the gates and run to you. If it doesn't come after a while, move around while continuing to call the horse.
11. Mount the horse and take it to any Stable, even the one you stole it from. Doesn't matter where.
12. Saddle up and enjoy your free horse!

### Remove scope from carcano and/or rolling block rifles.

[Source.](https://youtu.be/Mst4pshFcD0)

Want a scopeless sniper in place of a Bolt Action or Springfield? In story mode, you can permanently de-scope (un-scope?) both the Rolling Block and Carcano Rifles. This glitch isn't entirely permanent, but only because you can just go to a Gunsmith and re-equip any scope to negate it. The rifle(s) will remain scopeless as long as you don't re-scope them at the Gunsmith. They will not gain the auto-aim function even if it's turned on. They still operate as the regular rifle, you're just no longer forced to scope in.

1. Hop on your horse, equip either sniper, and place it in the saddle holster.
2. Enter any Gunsmith.
3. Change the scope on the rifle. (Doesn't matter which, it just has to be changed.)
4. While still viewing in the Gunsmith menu, equip the rifle to your shoulder.
5. Exit the Gunsmith and draw the rifle you holstered earlier (LB on XB1, unsure on PS4).
6. The scopeless rifle on your back will drop. Pick it up.

### Universal saddle blankets.

[Source.](https://youtu.be/vSIyry-KePE)

*Some Trapper saddles have unique blankets. This method does not work with two saddles which have thier own unique blankets. You can glitch the panther blanket with the Rattlesnake Vaquero Saddle but not with the Alligator Saddle.*

1. Enter a stable.
2. Equip the saddle which has the blanket you want to use.
3. Exit the stable.
4. Re-enter the stable.
5. Equip the saddle you want to use with the blanket.
6. Exit the stable.
7. Enjoy your Rattlesnake Saddle with a Panther blanket! (Or whichever combination you choose.)

### Saving Arthur's money for John.

[[Source.]](https://youtu.be/Gu5s3l6w7h0)

The **Aberdeen Pig Farm** is inhabited by an incestual brother and sister, whom together work as a team of serial killers. There is a sort of side mission with these two: as either John or Arthur you can eat dinner with them. During which they'll offer some drinks. After drinking a few times, you pass out and wake up in their body dump site with no money. A decent backing for sticking to the story, I think, is: Arthur gets robbed, John reads about it in his journal, John goes to the farm and takes the money as it's of no use to Arthur at that point. :)

Go there and get robbed as Arthur right before the mission **"Red Dead Redemption"** (the last mission in which the player controls Arthur) but do not go back and kill them, nor get your money. Wait until you take control of John, travel to the farm, and retreive the cash from the safe behind the picture of "Mama" directly behind the front door. Kill or spare them as you see fit.

### Getting gang horses

[[Source.]](https://youtu.be/yMr_xta-Q6s)

It's possible to obtain gang horses, even in the Epilogue. You can't bond with them, but this is a mod-less way to get them. All gang horses spawn at random with this method.

1. Be in at least Chapter 3.
2. Travel to **Horseshoe Overlook, Heartlands, NH**.
3. Replay the Chapter 2 mission `Americans At Rest` and complete it.
4. Travel back to **Horseshoe Overlook** and pick any gang horse.

### Getting out of bounds.

[OOB on San Luis River.](https://youtu.be/kYmREKUf09A)<br>
[OOB on San Luis River (alternate).](https://youtu.be/GfM9vxakKTA)<br>
[Bridge glitch.](https://youtu.be/VSRt7FPGItE)<br>
[OOB far northeast.](https://youtu.be/eppF2TnLt00)<br>
[OOB in Devil's Cave.](https://youtu.be/Kx0llq2e8qs)<br>
[OOB at Aurora Basin.](https://youtu.be/KKgIuLrLe8A) - using slide glitch.

You'll need enough alcohol to blackout to do this, and it works anywhere applicable. Most spots under cliffs work well. If you've got the **Wolf Heart Trinket**, you'll need a lot. Now, to get compendium entries and sketches as Arthur for animals specific to New Austin (and/or Guarma before/after of Chapter 5), or just to run around and explore, you can travel out of bounds via the far west end (at the edge of a drop-off) in the **Devil's Cave**. If you're running post-Epilogue and want to explore the southern side out-of-map or travel to Guarma much quicker, an infinitely faster method is to travel to a specific point on the southern shore of the **San Luis River**.) Do the following once at either location:

1. Drink until you black out.
2. Do nondescript things while blacked out. (How the character scales seemingly sheer surfaces whilst blackout drunk is unclear. Ah, the wonders of moonshine!)
3. Wake up out of map.

**GETTING TO GUARMA:** Guarma is located at the southeast (bottom right) corner of the map. Go in that general direction until you hit the low poly (jellytown) ground. Any low-poly area is considered the physical "end of the map" which you'll fall through. If you hit a 90-degree corner, turn on it (after turning you should be facing south). Follow the seam until you begin to float (walk up an invisible hill). Turn to face the low poly section, walk a few steps over the seam and Guarma's map will render in.

- A quick side note: I black out drunk on the east side of **Aurora Basin** and woke up on the west side out-of-bounds. I will try to replicate this soon, but the few times afterwards resulted in no joy.

### Glitching through locked interiors.

It's possible to glitch into locked interiors like **Taxodermist House**. This doesn't work on all surfaces, though.

1. In third person view, equip the lantern and a pistol/revolver.
2. Walk up to a wall or door and aim straight down dead center with whatever you're trying to glitch through. Angles are important for this, so it usually takes some finesse.
3. Go into first person view while still aiming. If you can see through the door/wall, you got the angle right.
4. Jump once. If you don't glitch through the wall, rinse and repeat.

### Speed crafting.

*This involves using third-party programs. Some recipies can be done seamlessly by holding A (on Xbox). For example, ammunition.*

Download [CheatEngine](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php). I use the RAR archive version which you don't have to join Patreon for; it doesn't come bundled with "optional" adware/bloatware like the installer does, but feel free to use what you want. Be sure to launch the 64-bit version of CheatEngine when using it in RDR2. Open "RDR2.exe" via the Open Process dialog and check "Enable Speedhack". You can adjust the speed as you see fit. When finished, uncheck the box to disable the speedhack.

Sometimes, a glitch may occur where the crafting process of some items (seemingly random) will freeze halfway through. I use 500x speed and travel near Colter when doing this, which seems to lower the chance of this happening.

I have not found a concrete way to alter item counts with CheatEngine. Looking into editing save files.

### Duplicate journal sketches.

Some POIs can be sketched as both Arthur and John (meaning two journal sketches per game):

- Cave Hermit
- Tree King
- Hermit Man
- Blind Man Cassidy
- Swamp Ghost
- Strange Statues

### Huge Bass with Kieran

In Chapter 3, while fishing at the second spot during **Fishing - Kieran**, a huge bass (reminiscient of the legendary bass found in the **San Luis River**) has a chance of spawning during the mission. It is not a legendary fish and cannot be mailed to Jeremy Gill.

### Double skins

If an animal can be picked up, you can get two ticks added to its `Skinned` counter in the **Compendium** by selling the skinned carcass to the Trapper or by donating it to camp. This does not yield two skins per animal, it just counts as skinning it twice.

# EASTER EGGS

Much information here was sourced from the [Red Dead Fandom](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Easter_Eggs_%26_Secrets_in_Redemption_2).

### Egg Notes

*Just some things I jot down before I find out what they are, if I ever do.*

- Random dead camper at dilapidated campsite just down the hill from **Hawks Eye Cabin, Big Valley, WE**. Only spawns at night.

### Witch in Graveyard

During `Angelo Bronte, A Man of Honor` (in Chapter 3), a woman dressed in all black with one cataracted eye can be seen running around several spots in the graveyard. She doesn't appear outside of this mission.

### Skinner Brothers Yelps

The sounds made by **Skinner Brothers** during ambushes and attacks are the same made by **Wapiti Tribe** members during **My Last Boy**. Likely just a borrowed scare tactic, but the **Skinner Brothers** might have some other motive in doing this. Perhaps some members are tied to the tribe and are protecting land in **Tall Trees**. Or maybe it's just the former. In either case, the jumpscare potential is unreal. Trotting along the paths, you hear screaming out of nowhere but you know what's coming.

### Voices at Old Camps

Voice lines from previous missions can be heard while traveling to previous camp locations. This also happens in Epilogue.

### Roanoke Forest Whispers

[Explanation on Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadmysteries/comments/9z42z3/roanoke_whispers_explained/)

Evidently, it's the voices of Ethel Boshared and Eugene Hutton, a couple who got lost in the forest. Some Theatres will show **The Ghostly Serenade**, which apparently tells the story of the couple.

### Woman in the Window

Seen at night peering out the second floor window of the house dead east of the junction at **Emerald Ranch, Heartlands, NH**.

### Trelawny's House

[[Reference.]](https://youtu.be/p-eA73N5y_c)

You can hear unique dialogue from inside Trelawny's house in **Saint Denis, Bayou Nwa, LE**.

### Writing on a Tree

A declaration of love carved into a tree trunk on the cliff north of **Flatneck Station, Heartlands, NH**. Extra carvings are added in the Epilogue. Seems to be carved by the boy casting stones into the **Dakota River**, whining about "Lily May".

### Bottle Tree

Lone tree with a bunch of bottles tied to it by strings and plenty more all around. Beside the path northeast of **Trading Post, Heartlands, NH** (point of interest).

### Zombie Well

Climbing to the bottom of the well at **Bear Claw, Tall Trees, WE** will change the lighting effects and show you as a zombie. Effect is negated if the Lantern or Miner's Hat is equipped.

### Bolger Glade Whispers

[Explanation on Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/ew1dx0/bolger_glade_sounds/)

### Lemoyne Ghost Train

https://youtu.be/_fSlasTGGag

### UFO

00:00-04:00 a stereotypically alien "UFO" shows up over **Hani's Bethel, Heartlands, NH**.

Another spawns in **Big Valley, WE**, southeast of the last 'N' in "MOUNT SHAN**N**". A small monolith can be found atop a cliff west of the path junction nearby, northwest of the 'M' in "**M**OUNT SHANN". Some miscellaneous gear can be found under a rock alongside the path southeast of the 'V' in "BIG **V**ALLEY".

### Witches Cauldron

Take a sip of that gray sludge. Found northwest of the 'N' in "AMBARI**N**O".

### Dragic's Creation

After completing Marko Dragic's mission strand, is "son" (the robot) can be found atop a cliff dead west of **Colter, Grizzlies West, AM**.

### Panoramic Map

A frozen couple holds the map northwest of the 'A' in "**A**MBARINO".

### Giant Snake

South of **Pleasance, Scarlett Meadows, LE**.

### Tally Marks in Well

Bottom of the well at **Compson's Stead, Scarlett Meadows, LE**.

### Gorilla

In a crate east of the bridge dead north of **Lenora View, Big Valley, WE**.

### Graves

A lone grave is under the **Warped Tree** east of **Larned Sod, Heartlands, NH**.

An old lean-to with three skeletons can be found northeast of **The Lookout Tower, Roanoke Ridge, NH**.

A wooden headstone listing many "workers" can be found northwest of **Copperhead Landing, Bluewater Marsh, LE**. West of the path parallel train tracks on the northern border of **Bluewater Marsh, LE**. It's assumed these were railroad workers.

A small graveyard can be found at a clearing in the forest dead west of the 's' in "Kama**s**sa River", southeast of **Osman Grove, Roanoke Ridge, NH**.

A lone grave marked with a skull on a stick can be found atop a cliff overlooking the **Upper Montana River** southwest of **Fort Riggs, Big Valley, WE**.

A desheveled and blood-stained tent is atop a plateau southeast of **Vetter's Echo, Big Valley, WE**. There's no body or grave, but it's presumed to be the final stand of someone against the same bear that can be found inside **Vetter's Echo** itself.

Dutch's mother is buried in the graveyard on the northwest side of **Blackwater, Great Plains, WE**.

A lone grave is near the shore southeast of the 'H' in "WEST ELIZABET**H**".

There's a skull on a stake next to a bull skull on a stump northeast of **Swadbass Point, Tall Trees, WE**.

### Undead Nightmare

The green mask from RDR1 Undead Nightmare can be found in the top left sheft behind the **Fence** shopkeep's counter in **Saint Denis, Bayou Nwa, LE**. [Reference.](https://youtu.be/lJm0PzXcRkA)

In the Epilogue, some Aztec symbols around **Blackwater, Great Plains, WE** can be sketched. [Reference.](https://youtu.be/TwQq9BbPNco)

### Strange Man

Some nods to RDR1. Only available in the Epilogue. When visiting **Bayall Edge, Bayou Nwa, LE**, a painting of the Strange Man is in progress. Pictures and other paintings in the cabin correlate to the player's honor level. Vultures and coyotes for negative, bucks and eagles for positive. The poem carved into the nightstand next to the couch changes based on whether or not you killed Jimmy Brooks in Chapter II. Over the next four visits to the cabin, the painting of the Strange Man will become more and more complete. On the final visit when the painting is completed, the Strange Man can be seen standing behind you in the mirror.

A picture of the Strange Man can be found behind the counter of the General Store in **Armadillo, Cholla Springs, NA**. Herbert Moon, the shopkeep, has some unique dialog hinting to the Strange Man as well.

### Crazy Guy in Treehouse

Northwest of the last 'N' in "NEW AUSTI**N**".

### Chelonians

A Chelonian can be found in room 1B during `Polite Society, Valentine Style`.

After speaking with the Chelonian in **Saint Denis, Bayou Nwa, LE**, a Chelonian group can be found committing suicide off a cliff southwest of **Veteran's Homestead, Grizzlies East, AM**.

A trio of dead Chelonians can be found northeast of the 'O' in "CH**O**LLA SPRINGS".

### Albert Mason Photos

His photographs are displayed at the Art Gallery (from `The Artist's Way - III`) in **Saint Denis, Bayou Nwa, LE**.

### Dead Man in Outhouse

Can be found inside the outhouse dead south of the 'H' in "MOUNT **H**AGEN".

### Frozen Explorer

[Reference.](https://youtu.be/NgYR4sXorW8)

Can be found at the northwesternmost edge of **Deadboot Creek, Grizzlies West, AM**.

### Dormin Crest

Cabin in **Grizzlies West, AM**, dead west of the 't' in "Deadboo**t** Creek". Tracks and a trail can be followed from the front door to a frozen man holding a repeater. This is thought to be a reference to the film *Jeremiah Johnson*.

### Frozen Cattle

[Reference.](https://youtu.be/WHdjFlmMTK8)

The cattle can be found in **Grizzlies West, AM**, dead east of the 'S' in "**S**pider Gorge". A lone skeleton can be found under a rockface near the northwest shore of **Lake Isabella**.

The **New Hanover Gazette No. 35** newspaper mentions the events which transpired. A friendly NPC camped southeast of **Oil Derrick, Heartlands, NH** (point of interest) will tell you of his story, which appears to link those frozen cattle and the lone skeleton at the lake.

This is thought to be a reference to the **Donner Party**, a real life group which became stranded while traveling out west.

### Black Sheep

Can be found in the southernmost pen at **Guthrie Farm, Heartlands, NH**. The black sheep can also be found alive roaming west of **Heartland Overflow**. Apparently, the dude married the sheep.

### Burned Wagon

South of the 'R' in "**R**IO DEL LOBO ROCK" in **Rio Bravo, NA**. Two dead men and two dead cows. Ground is burned and trees are dead.

### Antler Knife

A dead man and Grizzly Bear can be found northeast of **Stilt Shack, Big Valley, WE**. The Antler Knife is lodged in the bear's neck.

### Banjo Mutant

Found at **Butcher Creek, Roanoke Ridge, NH**. Based on a real life person.

### Pentagram

04:00-05:00 Glowing red under the northeasternmost cabin at **Butcher Creek, Roanoke Ridge, NH**.

### Blackwater Athletics Team

Found piled in a shallow grave in **Tall Trees, WE**. A reference to the team having gone missing is noted in the newspaper **Blackwater Ledger No. 69**. Evidently based on a real life amateur soccer team called "Los Maniceros" that went missing in Columbia in 2009.

### Hung Corpse

A man in a suit is strung up from a wagon roof beside the road north of **Macfarlane's Ranch, Hennigan's Stead, NA**.

### Some Notes

- Text within quotes, for example `"Willard's Rest"`, signifies text on the overworld (pause menu) map. Actual, in-game locations are noted in bold and not in quotes or a code block, as such: **Willard's Rest**. When describing placement relative to individual letters, the associated text will be in quotes and the individual letter(s) mentioned will be bolded. For example: west edge of the 'a' in "Will**a**rd's Rest".
- All reference locations (nearby plants, landmarks, etc) used are those which are the closest to where the animal was spotted. I try not to be vague, like "large rock next to the mountain". Some spawnpoints were a ways away from notable locations, and in those cases I've noted only landmarks and/or plants nearest to the spawnpoint as well as the animal's location relative to them.
- Random encounters don't seem to be tied to a specific time span, but for me all have occurred more often just after 10:00.
- Random encounters seem to appear more frequently if you save and reload in a nearby location or spend a great amount of time in the general vicinity. This includes all random encounters, including random events involving rival gangs. Setting up camp and sleeping has yielded less consistent results for me.
- The chance of random encounters does not change at any point if story mode, contrary to what I suspected. In `Simple Pleasures`, **Abe** says something I feel leans towards this being an actual mechanic put into the game for post-story play. [[Citation.]](#quotes) But, after extensive testing, random encounters are just as random regardless of story progression.
- It is possible to (apparently) increase the likelihood of random encounter spawning: hitch your horse and rest (kneel) a ways away from the point where whatever you're looking for is meant to spawn. Face away from the spawn while resting. Go do something else as time passes. I give at least six in-game hours, horse hitched and me kneeling. (That goes quicker with a timelapse function in a trainer.) After that short while, head towards the location. This is how I get the dodgy animal encounters to spawn more frequently.

## Rival Gangs

**NOTE:** The map `RDR2-RivalGangs.jpg` was discontinued some time ago now. It was getting a bit messy, but nearly every encounter, camp, and hideout location is marked.

- O'Driscolls and Laramies share some of the same random encounter locations.
- O'Driscolls are not meant to be present in the Epilogue. However two can be found stumbling out of Smithfields (Valentine, Heartlands, NH) at night. I also recall a video of a glitched train robbery random event southwest of Armadillo. The event is meant to involve Del Lobos, but due to some fluke it ended up being O'Driscolls. I have seen the former myself, but not the latter.
- The gang around Saint Denis are goons serving **Guido Martelli** (as per **Charles** during `Bare Knuckle Friendships`). [[Citation.]](#quotes) They don't have a known hideout, but are localized to parts of Saint Denis and appear in only random encounters.
- Lemoyne Raiders can be found in **Saint Denis** (Bayou Nwa, LE), but only during random encounters. They can be found at the same spots **Martelli's Men** stand at, but between the two is up to RNG. So far, I've run into Raiders standing around only twice. Also encountered them throwing Fire Bottles at a building in the southwest side of **Saint Denis**.

## Wild Animal Locations

### Western Bull Moose

*Primarily diurnal. Three coats: rust brown (almost orange), dark brown (almost black), and a gray-brown. Some coats and gender combinations can only be found at three specific spots, see below for details.*

See `RDR2-WesternBullMoose.jpg` for more locations.

**NOTE:** The most reliable spawns from my experience: Witches Cauldron (out of bounds) and Tall Trees (second 'L'). They're 24-hour spawn points and are the only two spots I'm aware of which allow all coats and both genders to spawn. Every other static spawn gives either a gray cow or orange bull and may as well be considered a random encounter given how rarely I've come across them elsewhere.

**NOTE:** I've found moose all over the map during sleet, mist, and fog. However they don't seem to spawn during rain or thunderstorm.

### Panther

*Primarily nocturnal. Three coats: two of the ordinary Panther and one of the Florida Panther. All are relatively similar. The Florida panther has a paler coat than the regular Panther, but there is a regular Panther coat which is very close to the Florida's albeit a tiny bit darker. All coats of both species spawn at all locations.*

See `RDR2-CougarPanther.jpg` for specific locations.

### Horned Owl

*Primarily nocturnal, but a few select spawns are active 24 hours. Three coats: Californian (rust brown), Coastal (tan gray), and Great (gray white). Owls seem to share many (if not all) perch locations with Hawks and Eagles. All perch spawns are also landing points, so all large birds can also spawn flying nearby, but land on the perch.*

Additional locations are marked in `RDR2-Owl.jpg`.

### Cougar

*Primarily nocturnal, but some spawn during the day. Four coats: orange/tan, light brown/tan (almost like buck pelt), gray (very similar to white, especially in moonlight), and white (mission-specific). Aside from random encounters, hotspots are northeast **Roanoke Ridge, NH** (mainly east of the **Kamassa River**) and north of **Ridgewood Farm** (Cholla Springs, NA).*

**NOTE:** The rare white cougar can only be found during `Money Lending and Other Sins IV` while hunting it with **Winton Holmes**. The gray coat can be found in the wild at random, and looks very much like a white cougar especially in the moonlight.

### Red Bellied Woodpecker

**NOTE:** Both species of woodpecker share most of the same flying and ground spawns.

*Primarily diurnal. Flies solo. Can also be found on the sides of tree trunks, as well as perched on bridges and atop large rocks (especially near bodies of water).*

*When perched on trees their pecking sounds are clearly distinctive, and it gets louder if you enter Eagle Eye. The pecking sound usually kicks in when you're about 15 paces from one. Since they blend into tree bark quite well, if you can hear loud pecking but cannot see anything highlighted in Eagle Eye it's probably on the opposite side of the tree trunk. Pecking sounds are not ambient audio, unlike mourning dove calls.*

Turkoman | Dark Bay | In **Chapter 3** during `Horse Flesh for Dinner`. Before starting the mission, discard/sell all possible horse food options, then fill up on **Sugar Cubes** from a **Stable**. Start the mission and continue until right after you rope in the escaped (untethered) horse. When John and Javier are mounted still next to the brothers who run the **Horse Fence**, dismount your horse, walk up to the Turkoman, and hold the prompt to feed it until you reach bonding rank 1 (and it becomes a temporary horse, shown by an icon on the map). Getting close to the brothers will trigger the next cutscene, so stay away from them while you're feeding the Turkoman.
Missouri Fox Trotter | Silver Dapple Pinto | (METHOD 1) During the random encounter where the woman's horse "Biscuit" has died and she needs a ride to Emerald Ranch, a glitch can occur where the horse, a Silver Dapple Pinto, will be found alive and can be claimed. Similarly, a woman needing a ride to Lagras will also have Silver Dapple Pinto that will occasionally spawn alive. One way to ensure this is to go stand upon Face Rock where the event spawns by, aim with a sniper rifle at the road below after which the event should spawn so long as the encounter has not been completed by the player prior, and keep shooting the lady. This causes both her and her horse to respawn, and eventually, it should respawn alive, and can be claimed by the player. [[Source.]](https://youtu.be/E3bM1zs83GM) [[Source.]]()<br><br>(METHOD 2) Another alternative way to obtain the Silver Dapple Pinto coat as Arthur is after the third encounter with Albert Mason `Arcadia For Amateurs III`. While herding the horses, go into Eagle Eye, track the Silver Dapple Pinto and then exit Eagle Eye while staying focused on the horse's trail. Once Mason photographs the herd, go to him and skip the cutscene as soon as it starts. Then follow the horse's trail, carefully and patiently, as the trail can be lost and the tracking process can last approximately up to 10 minutes. Once you find the horse, jump on it from your horse's back and ride it to the nearest stable without dismounting it to saddle it up or store it. Save the game and load the save file you just made. Then the horse will be yours to keep. [[Source.]](https://youtu.be/uaFjw5BlOZo) [[Source.]](https://youtu.be/DJgv9dChjPs) [[Wagon method.]](https://youtu.be/GqN3ygmcfwI)

### Testing Procedures

Here's some notes on what all I keep constant while playing:

- PC, latest version, locked at 60fps, V-Sync on, Triple Buffering on, mostly medium settings aside from low lighting qualities and ultra textures.
- All animals are tracked back to their original locations via **Eagle Eye**. All locations shown were verified at least twice before being marked.
- Dismount horse well away from spawn.
- Constant application of **Cover Scent Lotion**, as in once every 30 or so seconds.
- Slow approach, normal crouched walking.
- RampageTrainer (freeze/change time/weather; 2021/12/05 using Ignored By Wild Animals to pinpoint exact spawn locations)

### Release Format

You can download archives of maps in the `Releases` tab on the right side of this page. All releases are in 7z format with LZMA2 compression, so you'll need an archiving program capable of extracting LZMA2 7-zip archives. I use [7-zip itself](https://www.7-zip.org/), but you're free to use whatever you want.

In-game screenshots of the player sitting at a "sit" location are uploaded in their own, separate archives with the suffix `SitLocationsInGame` (i.e. `rdr2-maps-2021-11-07-SitLocationsInGame.7z`).
