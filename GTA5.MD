# GAMEPLAY

*Some notes about gameplay in general.*

### Tips

**Keep engine running.**

Equip any weapon, shoot (only one shot necessary) or melee with it, then immediately hop in your vehicle. When you exit, the engine will remain running.

**Shotguns in vehicles.**

You can use the **Sawed Off Shotgun** and **Auto Shotgun** while on a motorcycle.

**Stealing the Atomic Blimp.**

Land on top. Walk to very front edge. Enter vehicle.

**Carjacking at gunpoint.**

You can carjack at gunpoint with any pistol or assault rifle that comes with the enhanced version by default. Those are: Pisol, Combat Pistol, AP Pistol, Pistol .50, SNS Pistol, Heavy Pistol, Vintage Pistol, Assault Rifle, Carbine Rifle, Advanced Rifle, Special Carbine, and Bullpup Rifle. Equipping any special tint (gilded, wood grip, etc) disables carjacking at gunpoint with that weapon. Using standard tints does not. DLC pistols and assault rifles don't appear to be tied to the same animation sets, and as such do not trigger the pointing animations.

### Epsilon Variant Color

It's worn baby blue.

### Random Purchase Colors

Some vehicles can be obtained with a unique color combination by purchasing them from in-game websites. This happens randomly, so save before purchasing any vehicle you want in a specific color. There is no surefire method for specific colors, it's all trial and error. Reload the save and repeat until you get your desired color.

# RARE VEHICLES

Below are vehicles which are rare, but not missable. The type of vehicle being driven appears to affect what vehicles spawn. If you want a Turismo R or Zentorno, drive a Super car like an Infernus or Bullet GT. If you want a Coquette Classic, drive a Sports Classic like a Pigalle, Peyote, or Tornado (clean variant). If you want a Rat-Loader, drive any beater car or something old like a Hotknife or Blade.

When approaching any known spawn of significant rarity, drive slowly. I've found maintaining 20 mph and just barely touching the throttle works best.

### BEACH BUM UPDATE VEHICLES

I've found the **BF Surfer** (the clean variant) only as far south as the lot north of the **Del Perro** houses. It is quite common all the way north to **Paleto Bay** and I've found it sporadically throughout **Blaine County**. The **BF Surfer** does not appear to share any spawns with neither the **BF Bifta** nor **Canis Kalahari**. Because of that, and the fact it's *so* much more common, I'll be logging spawns of only the **BF Bifta** and **Canis Kalahari**. Both of which are quite localized, but share all the same spawns.

All of the mobile spawns are 24 hours. Most parked are daytime only, but just a few are 24 hour.

### Gang Vehicles

All gangs have their own colors painted onto their cars. Families' color is green, Ballas purple, Vagos yellow. Families are at the northern end of **Grove Street** in **Chamberlain Hills**. Ballas are at the southern end of **Grove Street**, also in **Chamberlain Hills**. Vagos are at the southwest end of **Jamestown Street** in **Rancho**. All gang vehicles spawn with the same upgrades, only the paint is different:

- Vapid Peyote
- Declasse Tornado
- Albany Manana
- Albany Buccaneer

Regular variants of each can be obtained at the bus junkyard on the intersection of **South Shambles Street** and **Hanger Way** in **El Burro Heights**. This location works most often at night, and the vehicles will not have any upgrades. Non-gang variants (with upgrades) can be found at **Olson's Autos** on **El Rancho Boulevard** in **Cypress Flats**. The vehicles found here have the same upgrades, but no specific paintjob.

### CONVERTIBLES

These vehicles have retractable roofs (or variants with retractable roofs).

# SECURITY VANS

If you see a truck but don't get close enough to activate the event (when the minimap displays the blue dot), you can travel to any other truck location and have it spawn without question. This can be done indefinitely until the event is activated.

If avoiding explosives, five shots from any weapon directly in the center of the doors will open them up.

There appear to be non-event trucks able to spawn in traffic. They scatter bill stacks (as opposed to a briefcase, like in events) when blown, GTA IV style. However the only one I've come across is in **Pillbox Hill**.

I've been able to consistently get a truck every 72 hours in game.
