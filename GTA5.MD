### Epsilon Variant Color

It's worn baby blue.

### Random Purchase Colors

Some vehicles can be obtained with a unique color combination by purchasing them from in-game websites. This happens randomly, so save before purchasing any vehicle you want in a specific color. There is no surefire method for specific colors, it's all trial and error. Reload the save and repeat until you get your desired color.

# RARE VEHICLES

Below are vehicles which are rare, but not missable. The type of vehicle being driven appears to affect what vehicles spawn. If you want a Turismo R or Zentorno, drive a Super car like an Infernus or Bullet GT. If you want a Coquette Classic, drive a Sports Classic like a Pigalle, Peyote, or Tornado (clean variant). If you want a Rat-Loader, drive any beater car or something old like a Hotknife or Blade.

When approaching any known spawn of significant rarity, drive slowly. I've found maintaining 20 mph and just barely touching the throttle works best.

### REGULAR VEHICLES

These are regular vehicles, just highly localized and/or generally hard to find.
