# INFORMATION

### Overview

All information gathered is from PC v1.0.2545.0, Uncracked, Rockstar Launcher panty-sniffing DRM.

All times are in military time as shown in game, a.k.a. military time.

### Latest Notes

The event of the Lazer flying over Raton Canyon doesn't appear to occur anymore. I've run as all three characters at all times of day, back and forth on trails each side of Cassidy Creek.

# GAMEPLAY

*Some notes about gameplay in general.*

### GROUND VEHICLE TIPS

**Carjacking at gunpoint.**

Carjacking at gunpoint prevents unarmed drivers from becoming hostile towards you. It can be done with any pistol or assault rifle that comes with the enhanced version by default. Those are: Pistol, Combat Pistol, AP Pistol, Pistol .50, SNS Pistol, Heavy Pistol, Vintage Pistol, Assault Rifle, Carbine Rifle, Advanced Rifle, Special Carbine, and Bullpup Rifle. Equipping any special tint (gilded, wood grip, etc) disables carjacking at gunpoint with that weapon. Using standard tints does not. Attachments do not affect the animation. DLC pistols and assault rifles don't appear to be tied to the same animation sets, and as such do not trigger the pointing animations. This can likely be fixed with mods. The `MP_Male` and `MP_Female` multiplayer models support the same animations.

**Keep engine running.**

Equip any weapon, shoot (only one shot necessary) or melee with it, then immediately hop in your vehicle. When you exit, the engine will remain running.

**Shotguns in vehicles.**

You can use the **Sawed Off Shotgun** and **Auto Shotgun** while on a motorcycle.

**Stopping on steep grades.**

Using regular brakes will not lock the car in place. Tap the handbrake when stopped. It'll lock the car's position regardless of grade.

**Off roading.**

Four wheel drive is helpful. Here's my personal picks for trails and offroading:

- Maxwell Vagrant (this thing trumps trails to pavement)
- BF Dune Buggy (good all-around; the **Dune FAV** is more prone to rollover)
- Vapid Blade (surprisingly good on trails and hillclimbs)
- BF Bifta (RWD takes getting used to but blazes trails once learned, poor hillclimb though)
- Vapid Sandking XL (decent all around, high suspension, average top speed, decent cornering, good hill climber)

### AIR VEHICLE TIPS

**What's the best plane?**

Well, up to the individual to check stats for themselves. Helicopters aren't affected by turbulence, but planes (generally) fly faster. Here's my personal favorites:

- Mammoth Hydra (VTOL, higher top and lower cruising speeds than **P-996 LAZER**, easy to land)
- Mammoth Dodo (amphibious, quite resistant to turbulence, very easy to land)
- Western Cuban 800 (well-balanced across the board, easy to land)
- Buckingham Alpha Z1 (immune to turbulence, fast cruise, somewhat difficult to land)

And helicopters:

- Maibatsu Frogger (well-balanced civilian heli)
- Buckingham Savage (well-balanced attack heli)

**How to land planes.**

Some are easier than others. Hold the decel (airbrake) about halfway down. Speed will begin to decrease. Holding decel any farther will shut the engine, and most jet-powered (and even some prop-powered) planes drop like a rock when doing so.

Gear down on approach. It increases air resistance, therefore lowering the maximum cruise (idle) speed.

**Stealing the Atomic Blimp.**

Land on top either by helicopter or parachute. Walk to the very front edge. Enter vehicle. You'll clip through as if the doors were blocked.

### AQUATIC VEHICLE TIPS

**Getting the SCUBA gear.**

You get it only by exiting a **Dinghy**, **Submersible**, or **Kraken**.

**Parking boats.**

There doesn't appear to be a solid way to keep boats where they are after entering them. The tide/current will guide them away from where you leave them. No aquatic vessel is exempt from this.

# RARE VEHICLES

Below are vehicles which are rare, but not missable. The type of vehicle being driven appears to affect what vehicles spawn. If you want a Turismo R or Zentorno, drive a Super car like an Infernus or Bullet GT. If you want a Coquette Classic, drive a Sports Classic like a Pigalle, Peyote, or Tornado (clean variant). If you want a Rat-Loader, drive any beater car or something old like a Hotknife or Blade.

When approaching any known spawn of significant rarity, drive slowly. I've found maintaining 20 mph and just barely touching the throttle works best.

**Pegassi Bati 801RR**
- Pick Karim Denz as the getaway driver during `The Jewel Store Heist`, and continue the heist as normal. Once reaching the point where the heist crew members enter the tunnel, instead of following them, continue down the highway and take a right on the first exit. Drive off the exit through a broken section on the right side barrier and then make another right turn. Activate the cinematic camera mode (R on keyboard, B on Xbox, Circle for PlayStation) to focus the camera angle on the crew before passing the **Union Depository**. Drive back to the **Franklin's House** garage without exiting the cinematic camera or getting dismounted (as it will automatically break the camera lock). While the camera angle can be disorienting, no traffic will spawn along the way, therefore drive slowly and carefully to avoid crashing. Park the bike in the garage, fail the mission, and retry from the last checkpoint. The Bati 801RR should be saved in the garage even after the heist is passed. Unknown if this works in Mission Replay; unlikely. [[Source.]](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Bati_Custom#Grand_Theft_Auto_V_2)

**Notes:**

- Certain vehicles seem to get rare cars to spawn more often. I've had the best overall luck with the **Vapid Blade**, **Dinka Akuma**, and **Dinka Double T**.
- Certain approach directions work more often than others, and are noted appropriately as `Approach from...`
- Daytime spawns are best checked around 12:00 noon. Nighttime spawns are best checked at 00:00 midnight.
- Weather doesn't seem to affect most spawns. Though I recall encountering more rare vehicles when it's clear. Maybe that's just because I generally don't drive in rain.
- Freezing time and (clear/sunny) weather via trainer helped tremendously when determining these times.
- Beach Bum Update vehicles **BF Bifta** and **Canis Kalahari** spawn from **Vespucci** to **Del Perro**. The **BF Surfer** (clean variant) has its own unique spawns, but can be found basically across the entire map.
- The **[N]** suffix indicates the spawn has its own spawn group, and only spawn with neons.
- Vehicles which are listed at the end of every bullet point are ones I've seen there myself.

### GANG VEHICLES

All gangs have their own colors painted onto their cars. Families' color is green, Ballas purple, Vagos yellow. Families are at the northern end of **Grove Street** in **Chamberlain Hills**. Ballas are at the southern end of **Grove Street**, also in **Chamberlain Hills**. Vagos are at the southwest end of **Jamestown Street** in **Rancho**. All gang vehicles spawn with the same upgrades, only the paint is different:

- Vapid Peyote
- Declasse Tornado
- Albany Manana
- Albany Buccaneer

Regular variants of each can be obtained at the bus junkyard on the intersection of **South Shambles Street** and **Hanger Way** in **El Burro Heights**. This location works most often at night, and the vehicles will not have any upgrades. Non-gang variants (with upgrades) can be found at **Olson's Autos** on **El Rancho Boulevard** in **Cypress Flats**. The vehicles found here have the same upgrades, but no specific paintjob.

# SECURITY VANS

If you see a truck but don't get close enough to activate the event (when the minimap displays the blue dot), you can travel to any other truck location and have it spawn without question. This can be done indefinitely until the event is activated.

If avoiding explosives, five shots from any weapon directly in the center of the doors will open them up.

There appear to be non-event trucks able to spawn in traffic. They scatter bill stacks (as opposed to a briefcase, like in events) when blown, GTA IV style. However the only one I've come across is in **Pillbox Hill**.

I've been able to consistently get a truck every 72 hours in game.
