I don't play a whole lot of FPS games. I'm not super competitive, so I wasn't prepared for how sweaty some PF lobbies can be. I crossed rank 100 around the end of June 2022, and have learned quite a bit in that time. I've played a lot of campaign FPS, primarily Halo CE (but also 2 and 3), Ghost Recon Wildlands (thousands of hours in solo and co-op, but only about 120 in Ghost War), and a bit of MW3 some years ago. Outside of those, I have little experience in multiplayer FPS. Though, I played MW2019 until late 2020 and have just under 1,200 hours on it. As for PF, I'm by no means SCL level competitive. I usually play the objective in every match, but I'm not looking to go for only kills either. Just looking to have some fun with folks who want to do the same.

*aka how to play the game*

Use a gun you have fun with, don't make the game a job. Yes, stereotypical, but there's a reason everyone has a ton of kills on one gun but (usually) not near as many on others. Here's the paradox, though: don't just stick with a single gun. You get `+200 XP` when you unlock an attachment on any gun. Not only that, in trying different guns you'll get a feel for how other (likely very different) guns operate. You might even run across another that you quite enjoy using.

Play the objective when in objective mode matches. Yes, all of them, including **CTF**. You can use the **Server Browser** to filter out non-objective mode lobbies. Playing the objective gives XP bonuses not present in **TDM**. For example, killing an enemy near the **Hardpoint** gives a `Defended Position` bonus. Here's a table of known XP sources:

Value | Label
:--- | ---
+400 | Captured the hill!<br>Captured a position!
+200 | Multi Collateral!
+150 | Triple Collateral!
+100 | Enemy Killed!<br>Multi Kill!<br>Double Collateral!
+75 | Quad Kill!<br>Killed Enemy Flag Carrier! **[CTF]**
+51 -> +99 | Assist Count As Kill! **[ALSO COUNTS ON GUN STATS]**
+50 | Assaulted a position!<br>Protected Flag Carrier!<br>Defended a position! **[KOTH]**<br>Triple Kill!<br>Wallbang Bonus!
+25 -> +75 | Killed from a distance! **[INCREASES OVER RANGE]**
+25 | Enemy Killed! **[TRUN]**<br>Suppressed Enemy!<br>Headshot Bonus!<br>Long Shot! **[INCREASES OVER RANGE]**<br>Double Kill!<br>Defended a position!<br>Secured Enemy Tag!<br>Secured Friendly Tag!<br>Saved by Teammate! **[CTF]**

+15 | Assisted by Teammate!**[CTF]**<br>Protected by Teammate! **[CTF]**
+10 | Holding hill
+1 -> +49 | Assist!

*Just some tips and tricks.*

- Do not blow your hard earned credits in the main game. There is a separate game alongside PF called **test place**. It's the current snapshot development version of PF, and you can find it by searching for `test place` on Roblox. Data will transfer over from main game, but changes/progress will not save. This allows players to not only test weapons with the new changes, but also prebuy guns, attachments, and skins to try them before buying them in the main game. (To get your credits back, just exit and reload into **test place**.)
- Don't camp. You will not learn the maps, nor will you get practice with movement if you just sit in one spot and wait for a kill the entire game.
- Don't spawntrap. Sure, you're maintaining the upper hand, but you're also ruining the fun for those you're spawnkilling who can't even get a shot off before they're smacked down. Remember there is no SBMM in PF, so lobby allocation might result in a team of all new players versus the other being all high ranks. And karma usually kicks in next round if you spawntrap, so treat other players how you'd prefer to be treated.
- Don't forget you have grenades and that cooking them is a thing. To toss a nade, tap `[G]`. To cook one, press and hold `[G]`. Grenades have varying fuse times, but learning to cook them properly while adjusted for throw distance gives you a great advantage around corners behind which you know someone is waiting.
- Know that bullet penetration ("pen") is a thing. Some guns have far better pen than others, while some can't even break through a plastic screen over a window.
- The **Server Browser** is a thing. You can use it either by clicking the button from the PF main menu in game, or by launching **PF UI Hub Dev** from Roblox. Use it to your advantage. Like playing only specific maps? You can join matches playing specific maps and/or modes via **Server Browser**.
- As with all other fast-paced FPS games, movement is everything. PF is no different. Over time, you'll come to favor select paths through all maps. Also in that time, you'll learn the spawnpoints to watch out for as you pass by or see them.
- Be aware that there is a `Toggle To Sprint` option in PF settings. Enabling it allows you to press `[SHIFT]` once and continue running without having to hold the button down.
- Press `[SHIFT]` to sprint, then `[CTRL]` to slide, then shortly before the slide is complete press `[SHIFT]` again. This maneuver is called a **slide cancel**. You cover more distance while sliding than you do while sprinting. Slide time will vary per gun, so you'll have to adjust your key press times according to whatever you're holding at the time.
- Press `[SPACE] + [X]` to **dolphin dive** (sometimes called "high jumping" or "double jumping"). It can assist in reaching spots inaccessible via normal jump (`[SPACE]`). You can avoid remaining proned after **dolphin diving** by tapping `[RMB]` shortly after the dive has started. This will make you ADS, but also changes your landing stance to standing, after which you can continue on sprinting.
- If your primary weapon has a slow walkspeed, switch to your secondary or melee while moving reasonable distances. Keep up your speed, and move from cover to cover.
- Try to hit heads. Almost all weapons have a high head shot multiplier.
- **TTK** is a lot, but not everything. If your gun has `34` max damage or greater, it will only take three limb shots to kill. Any gun with less than `34` max damage will always be a 4sk limb.
- Pay attention to details in the **Advanced Stats** tab. A gun with `32` max damage indicates a 4sk up close, but it might also have a `1.2` torso multiplier (meaning a single torso shot can deal `38.4` damage, therefore a 3sk).

# WhAtS tHe BeSt GuN?

*Whatever you have fun with.*

Most guns are better suited for particular niches, so use a gun you have fun with but that's also appropriate for the map/mode you're playing. If you enjoy using a gun, stick with it and learn it. Getting cracked with any gun only comes with use and practice over time. There's a long-debated war between two major playstyles: damage versus accuracy (low recoil). I side with the point of view favoring accuracy over damage, but most balancing trades one for the other. High damage matches the "spray and pray" style. Emphasis on movement and suppression. Usually goes alongside high penetration and recoil. High accuracy matches the "sweat" style, typically akin to "skill". Emphasis on shot placement and avoiding enemies. Usually goes alongside low damage.

Class | Range/Purpose
:--- | ---
Assault Rifle | Universal, jack of all trades.
Battle Rifle | Usually fit for longer range.
Carbine | Assault rifles fit more for closer range.
PDW | Close range.
Shotgun | Close range.
LMG | Long range. Suppression.
DMR | Medium to long range. Few excel in CQC.
Sniper Rifle | Usually long range.
Pistol<br>Machine Pistol<br>Other | Mostly CQC panic guns.
Melee | CQC only.

Statistically speaking, there are "meta" guns, but those change all the time with each update. Some guns get nerfed, others get buffed, so the "best" gun today might not be tomorrow. However, outside of SCL you'll often see players ranked 100+ using "low rank guns" like M4A1, MP5K, and Intervention. Or just some gun they enjoy using. Here's some popular choices:

Gun | Class | Rank | Details
:--- | --- | --- | ---
M4A1 | Carbine | 0 | Well-balanced performance between close and long range. Low recoil.
MP5K | PDW | 0 | Higher walkspeed than most SMGs. High RPM, low recoil. Recommend **Hollow Point** to push to 3sk limb in CQC.
Colt LMG | LMG | 0 | XP city. High suppression, high pen, big mag, deep reserves.
G18C | Machine Pistol | 17 | Perfect panic gun. High RPM, manageable recoil even in ADS.
M1911A1 | Pistol | 8 | High damage, moderate recoil, small mag, decent reserves.

You can also prebuy guns, attachments, grenades, etc. Are you lower rank and have some credits to spend? Here's some commonly recommended prebuys (which are statistically superior):

Gun | Class | Rank | Details
:--- | --- | --- | ---
Kriss Vector | PDW | 100 | Accurate and effective swarm of angry .45 ACP bees.
Hecate II | Sniper Rifle | 150 | Heavy rifle with 1sk torso/head at any range. Basically a **BFG 50** with a magazine.
ASMI | Machine Pistol | 97 | An **Uzi** in your pocket. Low fire rate but very low recoil.
M45A1 | Pistol | 34 | Fancy **M1911A1** with a bigger magazine and unique inspect animation. 2sk head/torso and 3sk limb in CQC.
Desert Eagle XIX | Pistol | 102 | Yeah, the big one. 1sk head/torso to decent range. Somewhat slow, but more controllable than **Executioner**.
Executioner | Revolver | 137 | 1sk head/torso to mad range. Stupid powerful, but slow.
Bundle Charge | Grenade<br>(High Explosive) | 168 | Crazy blast damage and range, but slow to arm and takes some skill to use effectively.

# WhAt ArE tHe BeSt AtTaChMeNtS?

Some rando rank 189 player in a public lobby:

> best attachments? *snort*

**If you're looking for XP, don't prebuy attachments. You'll get tons of XP for all the kills you get while unlocking attachments legitimately.**

### Optics

Use what you like. There is no definitive "best" optic. Needs and wants change per player per match. Having a universal optic cover all players' specific wants, as well as cover all possible engagement ranges on every map, is impossible. All optics have their own zoom level which can be viewed in the *Advanced Stats* menu. Common favorites are: 

Sight Class | Optic | Details
:--- | --- | ---
Iron | IWI | TAVOR irons. Low interference.
Iron | AAC Flip Up | Honey Badger irons. Low interference.
Red Dot | Delta | Low interference. Helps some players better center shot placement.
Red Dot | Reflex | Low interference. Small, single dot.
Red Dot | MARS | Moderate interference. Small, single dot. Integrated **Red Laser** with benefits. Sits above most static irons.
Red Dot | Coyote | Low interference. Small, single dot.
Red Dot | Barska Electro | Same as **Coyote Sight**, but with a reticle similar to **EOTECH**.
Red Dot | Kobra EKP | Basically a Russian **Reflex**. Sits above most static irons.
Red Dot | ACRO P-1 | Moderate interference. Tiny dot.
Scope | TA33 ACOG | Little clutter. .
Scope | VCOG 8x | Moderate clutter. 8x zoom.
Scope | Hi-Power 8-32 | **Remington 700** scope. Low clutter. 10x zoom.
Scope | Sidewinder ED | **Hecate II/TRG-42** scope. Low clutter. 10x zoom.

The general concensus on the "best" optic is the **Coyote Sight**, but with 2.0x zoom it's not the best for CQC encounters nor far ranges. Find an optic that's right for both the gun and you.

### Barrels/Muzzles

*All suppressor attachments greatly cut suppression.*

The run down:

- **Suppressor** and **PBS-1 Suppressor** are basically all benefits with no losses.
- You may as well use heavier suppressors (**R2**, **ARS**, **PBS-4**) for CQC weapons since the range loss usually doesn't matter.

Muzzle | Details
:--- | ---
Squad Barrel | Long barrel. Increases velocity and penetration. Cuts movement/aim speed.
Carbine Barrel | Short barrel. Increases headshot multiplier and movement/aim speed. Cuts velocity, penetration, and max range.
Flash Hider | Hides most muzzle flashes. Slightly improves camera recoil.
Compensator | Greatly reduces horizontal recoil. Increases vertical recoil.
Muzzle Brake | Greatly reduces vertical recoil.
T-Brake | Greatly reduces overall camera recoil, but not as much as **Muzzle Brake** or **Compensator**.
X-Ring | Improves displacement/rotational recoil. Slightly increases camera recoil.
Halbek Device | Functionally "reverses" recoil.
Loudener | Bigger muzzle flash and louder shot sound. Increases suppression. Slightly decreases velocity.
Muzzle Booster | Slightly increases RPM and camera/displacement recoil. Decreases suppression.
Suppressor | 70 stud radar ping. Slightly improves aimed rotational recoil.
R2 Suppressor | 50 stud radar ping. Slightly improves horizontal recoil. Increases vertical recoil. Slightly cuts max range and aim model speed.
ARS Suppressor | 35 stud radar ping. Greatly decreases camera recoil. Cuts aim model speed.
PBS-1 Suppressor | 70 stud radar ping. Slightly decreases displacement recoil.
PBS-4 Suppressor | 30 stud radar ping. Decreases rotational recoil. Slightly decreases max range and aim model speed.
Muffler | Radar ping remains the same. Decreases camera/rotational recoil. Increases recovery speed. Decreases RPM 10%.
Oil Filter | 5 stud radar ping. Slightly improves rotational recoil. Greatly improves recovery speed. Decreases RPM 15%.

### Grips

All grips do different things. Check what they do in the *Advanced Stats* menu. The **Angled Grip** and **Stubby Grip** are generally the best for automatic guns.

Grip | Details
:--- | ---
Vertical Grip | Improves hipfire groupings greatly.
Angled Grip | Improves camera recoil the same as **Stubby Grip** and improves aim speed (unlike **Stubby Grip**), but slightly increases rotational recoil. Shot groupings are very similar to **Stubby Grip**.
Potato Grip | Improves camera recoil, but not as much as **Angled Grip**. Increases rotational recoil same as **Angled Grip**. Integrated **Flashlight**. Cuts aim/equip speed, but not as much as other grips.
Skeleton Grip | Greatly improves aim and equip speed.
Folding Grip | Improves overall camera recoil, but increases max rotational recoil same as **Angled Grip**. Cuts aim/equip speed.
Stubby Grip | Improves camera recoil same as **Angled Grip**, but slightly increases min displacement recoil and cuts aim/equip speed.
Pistol Grip | Improves min and max transitional/rotational recoil. Slight cut to aim/equip speed. No effect on camera recoil.
Sideways Grip | Improves max camera recoil same as **Potato Grip**, but slightly cuts equip speed. No impact to aim speed. Makes recoil lean more to the left. Gives an **Alt Aim**.
HERA CQR Grip | Improves all recoil types, but cuts aim speed drastically.
Chainsaw Grip | Meme grip that restricts the gun to hipfire only.

### Lasers

Lasers have a few differences. Nothing massive, but differences nonetheless. The differences are so minimal that most players, including myself, argue for each player to use any laser they prefer. The **Yellow Laser** has an integrated **Flashlight**. The **Flashlight** itself helps tremendously in notoriously dark maps, but some players argue it's detrimental to their playstyle in the sense of the difference between lighting throws off their spatial awareness.

### Stocks

Stock | Details
:--- | ---
Full Stock | Greatly improves recoil, but cuts aim/walk speed.
Extend Stock | Basically a **Full Stock** with less benefits and losses. Improves recoil on most guns, but has no effect on some (like **Collapsible Stock**).
Retract Stock | Generally increases recoil but also improves aim/walk speed.
Collapsible Stock | Available on some AR platforms. Has no direct effect to gun stats.

### Ammo/Conversions

Ammo | Details
:--- | ---
**Armor Piercing** | Feasible on guns that have a base pen value of `1.00` or better. One stud of penetration is essentially nothing, but it can be brought up to `1.50` or greater which will go through at least one decent wall.
**Hollow Point** | Works best on CQC setups, but if you can hit heads these aren't worth the multiplier tradeoff. If you have a gun with less than `34` damage, using **Hollows** is only worth it if they bring the max damage up to at least `34` (allowing for a 3sk limb up close). However, if that gun has a torso multiplier which bumps the damage up beyond what it would be with **Hollows**, it may be best to not use them if you can land torso shots.
**Tracerless** | Essentially a **.223 Rem** conversion for all guns. It removes tracers and improves shot groupings as well as recoil, but cuts range, pen, and suppression.
**.223 Rem** | Available on all guns with **5.56x45mm** as stock ammo. Lowers camera recoil, but cuts damage and velocity.

# HoW dO i CuStOmIzE mY gUn SkIn

You get cases and keys by winning matches or by buying them. Only select skins are customizable, and are labelled as such when viewing the skinventory. Customizable skins can have their colors and textures/materials changed. The easiest way to get customizable skins are with **Starter Cases**, primarily **Starter 1**.

Below are some of my own I've played around with. Note that you may have to play around with the menu scaling to get these exact numbers. I use `/menuscale:1.3`.

Name | Material | Brick Colors<br>(RGB) | Texture Colors<br>(RGB) | Notes

Gun Metal | Metal | 47, 47, 47<br>70, 70, 70 | - | The stock metal colors of most guns and attachments.
Executioner/AK47<br>(Wood Grip) | Wood | 80, 60, 50 | - | The wood grain texture.
HK416 | Metal | 122, 104, 80 | - | The default color.
Honey Badger | Metal | 192, 152, 118 | - | The default color.
M2011 | Metal | 170, 20, 70<br>200, 200, 200 | - | Reddish-pink and off-white.

G3A3<br>(Green Trim) | Metal | 66, 80, 66 | - | The green grip, stock, and handguard color.
Beowulf ECR<br>(Brown Trim) | Metal | 81, 73, 73 | - | The brown grip, stock, and handguard color.
Damascus | Metal<br>Use Skins: Geography, Alabaster, Crimson Tissue<br>(All From Tier IV **Topograph Case**) | 0, 22, 255 | 255, 50, 0 | You can change the `STUDSPERTILEU` and `STUDSPERTILEV` values to expand/contract the textures.

# How To Calculate TTK

TTK, or *time to kill*, is exactly that: how long it takes to kill another player.

In Phantom Forces' case, there are torso and head multipliers which alter damage dealt based upon hitboxes. All weapons have a base damage which is for limb hits, but torso and head shots will deal (usually) greater damage. That being the case, TTK will vary based on shot placement. Here's how to calculate it:

1. Convert the gun's RPM to RPS (rounds per second) by diving the RPM by 60 (since there's 60 seconds in a minute).
2. Get the number of shots needed to deal damage either meeting or surpassing 100 (full health). This can be done by dividing `100` by the damage value. Since this will almost never yield a whole number, you must `ceil()` (round up) the result since you can't shoot (for example) a quarter of a single bullet. You can use the base damage values for limb hits as they always have a multiplier of `1.00`, but if you want to calculate TTK for torso/head shots multiply the base damage value by the gun's associated multiplier then divide `100` by the result.
3. Divide the number of shots to kill by the rounds per second.

Here's a quick equation for it:

ttk = ( `100` / ( *baseDamage* * *damageMultiplier* ) ) / ( *weaponRpm* / `60` )

And here's a quick example for CQC headshots with the **M4A1**:

`0.161` = ( `100` / ( `34` * `1.4` ) ) / ( `780` / `60` )

# How To Calculate Damage Drop Off

All guns have a **Damage Range** stat which indicates the distance each gun's damage gradually changes from `max` to `min`.

The full formula for damage lost per stud is:

`damageLostPerStud` = (`damageMax` - `damageMin`) / (`rangeMin` - `rangeMax`)

The first part `(damageMax - damageMin)` gives total damage lost over range. The second part `(rangeMin - rangeMax)` gives drop off range measured in studs. Dividing the first by the second gives damage lost per stud.

This example shows `0.125` damage is lost per stud over a total of `80` studs, and that a gun with these stats will 3sk limb to `92` studs:

`0.125` = (`40` - `30`) / (`140` - `60`)

You can also use that formula with multipliers, just apply them to the `damageMin` and `damageMin` values.

# Class Advantages

All weapon types have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Class | Purpose(s)
:--- | ---
Assault Rifle | Versatile. Usually jack of all trades, but master of none. Most players have the most kills on an AR.
Battle Rifle | Heavy assault rifles balanced between typical LMG and AR class stats. Higher damage and better range, but usually more recoil.
PDW | Usually focused on close-range combat. Generally have great handling and higher fire rates.
Shotgun | Excels in CQC, but falls off harshly at range.
LMG | Suppression and support weapons. Usually higher magazine capacity and ammo reserves.
DMR | Purpose-built for ranged combat. Some one shot to the head.
Sniper | Long range rifles. Most are bolt action where you must scope out to cycle the bolt.
Pistol | Sidearms which are meant to act as backup weapons. Some have great range though, and a few can one-shot to the head at reasonably long ranges.
Machine Pistol | CQC panic guns. Some have crazy high fire rates but terrible shot groupings.
Revolver | Usually harder-hitting in exchange for ammo capacity and fire rate, as well as extended range and the inability to equip a suppressor.
Other | Miscellaneous sidearms. Some are CQC versions of larger guns.

# Best Low Rank Loadout

Hard to call one sole loadout as each gun has its purpose(s). For a jack of all trades low rank loadout, I'd recommend:

- The **Colt LMG** turns every match into xp city. High suppression, high penetration, stupid stable recoil, and fast reload compared to other LMGs.
- The **G17** (*Pistol*) holds more rounds and has better recoil than the **M9**, but both pistols 3sk up close.
- The **Mk2 Frag** is unlocked at rank 1 and is a bit better in practice than the M67 Frag.
- The **Combat Knife** is a base unlock melee, but even being a last-resort weapon it's still decent.

**Some Alternatives:**

- The **M4A1** performs quite a bit better in close quarters than the **AK12**. Ranged damage falls off to a 6sk, but given it's a *Carbine* it's not meant for ranged combat. It does have a **7.62x39mm** conversion which retains the 3sk up close but improves long range to a 5sk. The recoil is quite good despite being a stereotypically higher recoil conversion.
- The **SCAR-L** is a beast of a gun unlocked at rank `16`. Reliable 4sk at all ranges and stupid stable recoil.
- The **Type 20** is a better **SCAR-L**, but is unlocked at rank `37`.
- The **MP5K** works wonders in CQC. High rate of fire and 3sk up close, along with higher than average walk speed.
- The **UMP45** is a PDW unlocked at rank `5` and performs like a small **SCAR-L**. Due to its lower fire rate it takes some getting used to.
- The **MK11** is unlocked at rank `3` and is arguably the best well-rounded *DMR*. Higher than average velocity, reliable 2sk heads and 3sk torso/limb at all ranges. The fire rate limit takes some getting used to, but just like with any other gun if you learn it you can obliterate with it. (See [Fire Rate and Macros](#fire-rate-and-macros) for more info.)
- The **Intervention** seems to be the one *Sniper Rifle* that fits the most people's needs and wants. Higher than average velocity and reliable torso kill to quite far out, but headshots are a must at very far ranges.
- The **G18C** is a machine pistol unlocked at rank `17`, and is a fantastic panic weapon with 1100 rpm, decent recoil in both ADS and hipfire (though ADS with machine pistol is kind of pointless), low TTK, and heavy bags of reserve ammo.

# Fire Rate and Macros

So, a lot of players on every FPS game ever will argue that it's technically cheating to use any macro. I'm not here to debate that, I'm here to give my experience in trying such things.

- Using a macro to lower a gun's fire rate can produce interesting results. I've macro'd the **C8A2** down to 750 rpm and perform a bit better than with the stock 900 rpm. I've also macro'd the **Beowulf ECR** with stock ammo down to 500 rpm, and guess what? Those 11 rounds don't burn up nearly as quick, and I performed way better than with the stock 780 rpm. In addition, I've macro'd the **MK11** and **Beowulf TCR**. Oddly enough, I can match their fire rate limit a lot better now than I could before using the macro.
- You can turn any semi-automatic gun into full auto. Want a shotgun with birdshot in full auto but don't want to use the **AA-12**? Macro is the answer.
- Some certain people have advised using a metronome to learn the fire rate of any semi-auto gun. This is just an alternative method to using a macro, and given everyone learns differently I feel it's proper to also recommend trying a metronome. If it clicks with you (pun definitely *not* intended), so be it.
- The gun that's the most fun to macro is by far the **ZIP-22**.

**Despawn**

Certain places allow you to despawn back to the lobby menu without having it count as a death. This is almost exclusively done by mesh glitching, and can be handy if you want to maintain a high KDR for whatever reason.
