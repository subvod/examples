### tl;dr is it worth it?

For sure. Continue reading for details.

### Is it better than the 2020 model/version?

Arguably, yes. In the 2020 model, you get the updated hardware as opposed to its matching counterpart (AMD R9-4900HS and RTX-2060). I had the 2020 model for two months, during which I ran the same tests and games. The performance difference is most noticable in RDR2, where the 2020 model consistently runs a mere 3 fps slower. Oh no! That's a game-changing difference, right?! As far as I'm concerned, no. I got the 2020 model on special at Best Buy for $1,200. The $1,600 price tag of the 2021 model is quite a jump but from what I've tested not worth the $400 difference. The only reason I bought the 2021 model was to have current-day hardware just to squeeze out a bit more lifetime out of this little monster. If you're looking for the 2021 model, but cheaper and a mere 3fps slower all-around, go for the 2020 model.

### What am I comparing it to?

I'm coming from an **Acer ASPIRE 5250-P5WE6**. It's done what I've thrown at it just fine since I got it in 2012. Ran Halo CE and Homeworld 2 flawlessly (on low settings, of course). Also ran emulators great, as if they are/were power-hungry. The 17" screen is nice, but as far as I'm concerned a 14" doesn't make a whole lot of difference when I can just HDMI it to a larger monitor.

### Gaming Performance

I don't play a whole lot of games. I still occasionally play *Homeworld 2 Remastered*, but for the most part I play *Red Dead Redemption 2*. This tiny thing...

It can run RDR2, all medium settings (except with texture and all anti-aliasting settings on Ultra) at a consistent 45-58 fps. The lowest drop I've seen is 44fps when I was lobbing dynamite arrows one after another during a bounty hunter ambush. Now, I do run V-Sync because anything higher than 60 Hz doesn't make a difference to me even though the laptop screen itself can run at 144 Hz. (Plus, my TV I connect it to runs max 60fps in 1080p.)

I do play a bit of Forza Horizon 3 and 4 as well. I've yet to test FH4, but FH3 runs (on default "Medium" recommended settings) at a consistent 102-114 fps, with the lowest drop I've seen to date being 94 fps during a large multiplayer circuit race. (Possibly due to network latency, but I'll mention it nonetheless.)

As the old Acer did, it emulates all pre-2005 (physical) systems flawlessly.

### Programming (Keyboard)

Some people have compained about the keys on the keyboard... I've no clue what these people are on about. Keyboard works fine 24/7 for me.

Programming wise, ehh. I mean, how much power do you need? My old Acer ran fine. Compile times for C/C++ and execution times for Python are reasonably faster than the Acer, but on both it's essentially instant. It will fill the requirements of all day-to-day hobbyist developers like myself. I've no proper ground to make an argument for professional developers, but I reckon it'll fill that role as well.
